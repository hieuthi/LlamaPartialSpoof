## FAQ

### 01. How should the data be used?
- LlamaPartialSpoof was designed for evaluation hence we didn't provided training data. We want researchers to develop a system that either trained on a third-party dataset (e.g. PartialSpoof) or using a non-training method so it can generalize to real life scenarios.
- However if you want to train on the dataset, we suggest using k-fold to split the speakers and the method for training, validating, and testing.


## Have a question?

It may take sometimes for us to get back but we love to connect with the research community on this topic.
