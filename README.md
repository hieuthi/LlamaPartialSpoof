## Updates
- 2025-01-07 The paper "LlamaPartialSpoof: An LLM-Driven Fake Speech Dataset Simulating Disinformation Generation" is accepted, we will give a presentation on this topic at ICASSP 2025 in Hyderabad, India around April 6 to 11, 2025

## FAQ

### 01. How should the data be used?
- LlamaPartialSpoof was designed for evaluation hence we didn't provided training data. We want researchers to develop a system that either trained on a third-party dataset (e.g. PartialSpoof) or using a non-training method so it can generalize to real life scenarios.
- In the paper [Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics, Models, and Out-of-Domain Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03468) we split the dataset speakers into train and test subset to test continous learning scenarios. You can find the data partitions in the `split/` directory. 

### 02. Baseline mode
- I prepared a baseline system with the processing pipeline to benchmark this dataset at [MultiResoModel (Simple)](https://github.com/hieuthi/MultiResoModel-Simple)

### 03. Modified transcipts
- The original `dev-clean`, `test-clean` transcripts and the modified `dev01` transcripts are included in this repository

## Have a question?
If you have any question or feedback, feel free to create [a new issue](https://github.com/hieuthi/LlamaPartialSpoof/issues) in this repository.
It may take sometimes for us to get back but we love to connect with the research community on this topic.
