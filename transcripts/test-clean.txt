5639_40744_000018_000002 But, as the proverb says, with the disease God sends the remedy.
5639_40744_000027_000002 Rodolfo thanked her, and supper being ready they went to join the rest of the party at table.
5639_40744_000022_000000 Just then Leocadia came to herself, and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears, and the gentleman remained in utter bewilderment, until his wife had repeated to him, from beginning to end, Leocadia's whole story; and he believed it, through the blessed dispensation of Heaven, which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies.
5639_40744_000015_000000 Many gentlemen followed him, greatly distressed at the sad accident which had befallen the general favourite; for it was soon on everybody's lips that the sufferer was little Luis.
5639_40744_000015_000002 The gentleman who had humanely taken charge of him being of eminent rank, and well known, they easily found their way to his house, and arrived there just as Luis was under the surgeon's hands.
5639_40744_000012_000003 For this and other reasons, Rodolfo readily complied with the wishes of his father, who gave him ample letters of credit on Barcelona, Genoa, Rome, and Naples.
5639_40744_000028_000001 The season being winter, she was dressed in a robe and train of black velvet, with gold and pearl buttons; her girdle and necklace were of diamonds; her head was uncovered, and the shining braids and ringlets of her thick chestnut hair, spangled with diamonds, dazzled the eyes of the beholders.
5639_40744_000004_000011 But you must also swear not to follow me, or make any attempts to ascertain my name or that of my family, who if they were as wealthy as they are noble, would not have to bear patiently such insult in my person.
5639_40744_000015_000011 The lady of the house spoke to the same effect, and with no less kindness and cordiality.
5639_40744_000029_000005 He was greatly confused at finding that he had betrayed such emotion; but his mother, who guessed his thoughts, said to him, "Do not be ashamed, my son, at having been so overcome by your feelings; you would have been so still more had you known what I will no longer conceal from you, though I had intended to reserve it for a more joyful occasion.
5639_40744_000018_000003 The boy found his recovery in this house; and I found in it reminiscences of events I shall never forget as long as I live.
5639_40744_000003_000006 Mother! dear father! do you hear me?
5639_40744_000003_000001 Rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of Leocadia, and made up his mind to lay her in the street, insensible as she was.
5639_40744_000006_000002 She succeeded in opening the window; and the moonlight shone in so brightly, that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room.
5639_40744_000010_000005 Real dishonour consists in sin, and real honour in virtue.
5639_40744_000023_000001 After a prosperous run of twelve days, he reached Barcelona, whence he posted in seven to Toledo, and entered his father's house, dressed in the very extreme of fashionable bravery.
5639_40744_000003_000000 Apathy and disgust commonly follow satiated lust.
5639_40744_000020_000004 This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son."
5639_40744_000027_000001 She told him that she would endeavour to marry him in conformity with his inclination, and that he need not make himself uneasy, for there would be no difficulty in breaking off the match which seemed so distasteful to him.
5639_40744_000020_000001 On seeing his wife all in tears, and Leocadia fainting, he eagerly inquired the cause of so startling a spectacle.
5639_40744_000008_000002 Having come to this resolution, he hastened back to remove Leocadia before daylight appeared, which would compel him to keep her in his room all the following day.
5639_40744_000013_000000 Time rolled on: the hour of her delivery arrived: it took place in the utmost secrecy, her mother taking upon her the office of midwife: and she gave birth to a son, one of the most beautiful ever seen.
5639_40744_000007_000001 Among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver, standing on a cabinet near the window.
5639_40744_000013_000002 The boy, who was named Luis after his grandfather, was remarkably handsome, of a sweet docile disposition; and his manners and deportment, even at that tender age, were such as showed him to be the son of some noble father.
5639_40744_000022_000001 He embraced and comforted Leocadia, kissed his grandson, and that same day he despatched a courier to Naples, with a letter to his son, requiring him to come home instantly, for his mother and he had concluded a suitable match for him with a very beautiful lady.
5639_40744_000003_000011 In mercy kill me this moment!
5639_40744_000027_000003 The father and mother, Rodolfo and his two companions had already seated themselves, when Dona Estafania said, in an off hand way, "Sinner that I am, how well I behave to my guest!
5639_40744_000013_000003 His grandfather and grandmother were so delighted with his grace, beauty, and good behaviour, that they came at last to regard their daughter's mischance as a happy event, since it had given them such a grandson.
5639_40744_000028_000009 She reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever, and racked by the intensity of her emotions, she suddenly changed colour, her head dropped, and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed Estafania.
5639_40744_000015_000001 The news speedily reached the ears of his grandparents and his supposed cousin, who all hurried in wild dismay to look for their darling.
5639_40744_000012_000007 What she had thus done voluntarily at first, she found herself, in a few months, constrained to do by necessity; for she discovered that she was pregnant, to the grievous renewal of her affliction.
5639_40744_000016_000006 She made all this known to her husband; and it was finally settled between the three that they should not move in the matter for the present, but wait till the will of Heaven had declared itself respecting the little patient.
5639_40744_000001_000002 Finally, the one party went off exulting, and the other was left in desolation and woe.
5639_40744_000028_000002 Her bearing was graceful and animated; she led her son by the hand, and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks.
5639_40744_000015_000009 The gentleman replied that there was nothing to thank him for; the fact being, that when he saw the boy knocked down, his first thought was that he saw under the horses' heels the face of a son of his own, whom he tenderly loved.
5639_40744_000004_000009 I am surprised at it myself; and I perceive that if great sorrows are sometimes dumb, they are sometimes eloquent. Be this as it may, grant me the favour I implore: it will cost you little.
5639_40744_000005_000001 "Base villain," she cried, "you took an infamous advantage of me when I had no more power to resist than a stock or a stone; but now that I have recovered my senses, you shall kill me before you shall succeed.
5639_40744_000015_000003 The master and mistress begged them not to cry, or raise their voices in lamentation; for it would do the little patient no good.
5639_40744_000016_000001 The damask hangings were no longer there; but she recognised it by other tokens. She saw the grated window that opened on the garden: it was then closed on account of the little patient; but she asked if there was a garden on the outside, and was answered in the affirmative.
5639_40744_000017_000000 Luis was out of danger in a fortnight; in a month he rose from his bed; and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother, and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child.
5639_40744_000011_000001 In spite of all their tenderness her anguish was too poignant to be soon allayed; and from that fatal night, she continued to live the life of a recluse under the protection of her parents.
5639_40744_000014_000000 One day, when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation, he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen.
5639_40744_000026_000005 As for high birth, thank Heaven and my ancestors I am well enough off in that respect; as for understanding, provided a woman is neither a dolt nor a simpleton, there is no need of her having a very subtle wit; in point of wealth, I am amply provided by my parents; but beauty is what I covet, with no other addition than virtue and good breeding.
5639_40744_000024_000001 She earnestly entreated them to tell her, if they remembered that her son had carried off a young woman, on such a night, so many years ago; for the honour and the peace of mind of all his relations depended on their knowing the truth of that matter.
5639_40744_000020_000002 The boy having embraced his mother, calling her his cousin, and his grandmother, calling her his benefactress, repeated his grandfather's question.
5639_40744_000028_000003 All rose to do her reverence, as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them; but gazing on her, entranced with admiration, not one of them was able to address a single word to her.
5639_40744_000004_000008 You may wonder to hear me speak thus, being so young.
5639_40744_000012_000002 Rodolfo had long contemplated a visit to Italy; and his father, who himself had been there, encouraged him in that design, telling him that no one could be a finished gentleman without seeing foreign countries.
5639_40744_000012_000000 Rodolfo meanwhile having returned home, and having missed the crucifix, guessed who had taken it, but gave himself no concern about it.
5639_40744_000007_000004 In about half an hour, as it seemed to her, the door was opened; some one came in, blindfolded her, and taking her by the arm, without a word spoken, led her out of the room, which she heard him lock behind him.
5639_40744_000000_000004 But Rodolfo had been struck by the great beauty of Leocadia, the hidalgo's daughter, and presently he began to entertain the idea of enjoying it at all hazards.
5639_40744_000033_000002 The four grandparents wept for joy: there was not a corner of the house but was full of gladness; and though night was hurrying on with her swift black wings, it seemed to Rodolfo that she did not fly, but hobble on crutches, so great was his impatience to be alone with his beloved bride.
5639_40744_000030_000003 This was done; for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage, without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required.
5639_40744_000009_000001 To baffle any spies that might perchance be watching her, she entered a house which she found open; and by and by she went from it to her own, where she found her parents stupefied with grief.
5639_40744_000024_000003 They added that Rodolfo told them, on the following day, that he had carried the girl to his own apartment; and this was all they knew of the matter.
5639_40744_000003_000009 Whoever thou art," She exclaimed, suddenly seizing Rodolfo's hand, "if thy soul is capable of pity, grant me one prayer: having deprived me of honour, now deprive me of life.
5639_40744_000024_000000 It was nearly night when Rodolfo arrived; and whilst preparations were making for supper, Estafania took her son's companions aside, believing that they were two of the three whom Leocadia mentioned as having been with Rodolfo on the night of her abduction.
5639_40744_000017_000001 Dona Estafania, the kind gentleman's wife, often observed, in conversation with Leocadia, that the boy so strongly resembled a son of hers who was in Italy, she never could look at him without thinking her son was actually before her.
5639_40744_000012_000006 She meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face.
5639_40744_000010_000003 What you had best do, my child, is to keep it, and pray to it, that since it was a witness to your undoing, it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment.
5639_40744_000006_000004 She counted the chairs and the cabinets, observed the position of the door, and also perceived some pictures hanging on the walls, but was not able to distinguish the subjects.
5639_40744_000003_000005 Am I in bed?
5639_40744_000021_000000 "Unless you speak more fully, senora, I cannot understand you," replied her husband.
5639_40744_000015_000007 The surgeon desired them not to talk to him, but leave him to repose.
5639_40744_000014_000003 The poor child lay senseless on the ground, bleeding profusely from his head.
5639_40744_000029_000006 Know then, son of my heart, that this fainting lady is your real bride: I say real, because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you, and the portrait was a pretence."
5639_40744_000000_000002 The two parties, the sheep and the wolves, met each other. Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the servant maid.
5639_40744_000002_000001 They were afraid to appeal for justice to the laws, lest thereby they should only publish their daughter's disgrace; besides, though well born they were poor, and had not the means of commanding influence and favour; and above all, they knew not the name of their injurer, or of whom or what to complain but their luckless stars.
5639_40744_000028_000000 The lady soon appeared, presenting a most charming spectacle of perfect beauty, set off by the most appropriate adornments.
5639_40744_000031_000000 "Once when I recovered from a swoon," replied Leocadia, "I found myself, senor, in your arms without honour; but for that I have had full compensation, since on my recovery from my this day's swoon I found myself in the same arms, but honoured.
5639_40744_000026_000006 If my wife brings me this, I will thank Heaven for the gift, and make my parents happy in their old age."
5639_40744_000006_000001 She found the door, but it was locked outside.
5639_40744_000027_000004 Go," she said to a servant, "and ask the senora.
5639_40744_000000_000000 There was in that city a young cavalier, about two and twenty years of age, whom wealth, high birth, a wayward disposition, inordinate indulgence, and profligate companions impelled to do things which disgraced his rank.
5639_40744_000006_000005 The window was large, and protected by a stout iron grating: it looked out on a garden, surrounded by high walls, so that escape in that direction was as impossible as by the door.
5639_40744_000009_000002 They had not undressed, or thought of taking any rest.
5639_40744_000028_000008 The hopes her mother had given her of being his wife began to droop, and the fear came strong upon her that such bliss was not for one so luckless as herself.
5639_40744_000023_000003 Rodolfo's two comrades proposed to take leave of him at once, and retire to their own homes; but Estafania would not suffer them to depart, for their presence was needful for the execution of a scheme she had in her head.
5639_40744_000033_000000 At last they sat down to a merry supper to the sound of music, for the performers, who had been previously engaged, were now arrived.
5639_40744_000016_000003 Finally, to corroborate all the other indications, and confirm the truth of her discovery beyond all question, she counted the steps of the staircase leading from the room to the street, and found the number exactly what she had expected; for she had had the presence of mind to count them on the former occasion, when she descended them blindfold.
5639_40744_000003_000010 Let me not survive my disgrace!
5639_40744_000016_000002 The bed she too well remembered was there; and, above all, the cabinet, on which had stood the image she had taken away, was still on the same spot.
5639_40744_000003_000012 It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me."
5639_40744_000029_000002 This shocking news reached the ears of her parents, whom Dona Estafania had concealed in another room that they might make their appearance at the right moment.
1580_141084_000091_000003 Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday, when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was mr Gilchrist's tan gloves a lying in that chair.
1580_141084_000040_000001 It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six.
1580_141084_000050_000004 I'll take the armchair in the middle.
1580_141084_000085_000000 "Good heavens! have you nothing to add?" cried Soames.
1580_141084_000082_000000 Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister.
1580_141084_000005_000001 What's that?
1580_141084_000028_000002 Why should a perfectly honest man-Well, well, here's a large stationer's.
1580_141084_000015_000000 Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay.
1580_141084_000076_000008 How did he know?
1580_141084_000050_000006 Kindly ring the bell!"
1580_141084_000008_000000 "No difficulty in the world," Soames answered.
1580_141084_000009_000003 Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own.
1580_141084_000030_000002 But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it.
1580_141084_000082_000007 You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door.
1580_141084_000063_000000 "Ah, that's a pity, Bannister.
1580_141084_000084_000000 "Yes, sir, it is true," said he.
1580_141084_000092_000000 "No, indeed," said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.
1580_141084_000082_000003 As we know, he came back by the side gate.
1580_141084_000072_000000 "No, no, mr Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word-never one word!" cried the servant.
1580_141084_000091_000006 I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until mr Soames he went for you.
1580_141084_000007_000000 "I should like to have a peep at each of them," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000088_000000 Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
1580_141084_000056_000000 "Nothing at all, sir."
1580_141084_000025_000000 "Who?"
1580_141084_000009_000008 "I don't care who you are.
1580_141084_000013_000000 "Really, mr Holmes, I cannot undertake to say.
1580_141084_000047_000000 "But this rascal?"
1580_141084_000086_000000 "Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me.
1580_141084_000018_000003 Good bye."
1580_141084_000069_000001 He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face.
1580_141084_000041_000001 On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.
1580_141084_000091_000001 Time was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman's father. When he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world.
1580_141084_000087_000001 "But why did you change your purpose?"
1580_141084_000017_000000 "Very good, mr Holmes."
1580_141084_000086_000003 Here it is, sir.
1580_141084_000009_000007 The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.
1580_141084_000050_000003 Watson you here!
1580_141084_000074_000001 The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.
1580_141084_000065_000000 "There was no man, sir."
1580_141084_000051_000000 Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.
1580_141084_000036_000000 "I think so."
1580_141084_000022_000001 Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart."
1580_141084_000064_000000 The man's face set in sullen defiance.
1580_141084_000016_000001 I shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over.
1580_141084_000057_000000 "Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you.
1580_141084_000059_000000 "No, sir, certainly not."
1580_141084_000046_000000 "Yes, let it proceed, by all means."
1580_141084_000083_000000 The student had drawn himself erect.
1580_141084_000079_000002 As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were.
1580_141084_000007_000001 "Is it possible?"
1580_141084_000021_000001 He is the one with the worst record.
1580_141084_000089_000000 "There is the man who set me in the right path," said he.
1580_141084_000022_000000 "There is nothing in that.
1580_141084_000071_000000 The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
1580_141084_000026_000001 What's his game in the matter?"
1580_141084_000091_000008 Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed?
1580_141084_000006_000000 It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.
1580_141084_000079_000005 It was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.
1580_141084_000082_000002 He thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him.
1580_141084_000029_000001 All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock.
1580_141084_000040_000000 "Aha!
1580_141084_000043_000000 "And one more this morning.
1580_141084_000030_000000 "No good, my dear Watson.
1580_141084_000080_000002 What was it you put on that chair near the window?"
1580_141084_000086_000002 It was before I knew that my sin had found me out.
1580_141084_000055_000000 "Nothing to add?"
1580_141084_000076_000001 The printer one could, of course, dismiss.
1580_141084_000069_000000 An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student.
1580_141084_000035_000000 "Have you anything positive to tell him?"
1580_141084_000009_000005 I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.
1580_141084_000076_000002 He could examine the papers in his own office.
1580_141084_000070_000001 "Now, mr Gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us.
1580_141084_000078_000000 "I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table.
1580_141084_000077_000002 Such an idea was absurd.
1580_141084_000016_000002 It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
1580_141084_000014_000000 "That is very important," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000014_000001 "And now, mr Soames, I wish you good night."
1580_141084_000076_000007 The man who entered knew that the papers were there.
1580_141084_000027_000000 "He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man."
1580_141084_000077_000003 I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.
1580_141084_000032_000001 Can you do without breakfast?"
1580_141084_000063_000001 Up to now you may have spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied."
1580_141084_000054_000000 "I have told you everything, sir."
1580_141084_000081_000000 "Gloves," said the young man.
1580_141084_000015_000005 The situation must be faced."
1580_141084_000015_000003 I must take some definite action to night.
1580_141084_000015_000001 "Good gracious, mr Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion! You don't seem to realize the position.
1580_141084_000052_000000 "You will kindly close the door," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000049_000000 "You know him?"
1580_141084_000026_000000 "Why, Bannister, the servant.
1580_141084_000020_000005 Which is yours?"
1580_141084_000016_000003 Meanwhile, you change nothing-nothing at all."
1580_141084_000076_000005 On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table.
1580_141084_000079_000003 No harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
1580_141084_000038_000000 "Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery."
1580_141084_000082_000001 "He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them.
1580_141084_000075_000001 Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell mr Soames what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong.
1580_141084_000068_000000 "In that case, you can give us no further information.
1580_141084_000082_000010 Have I told the truth, mr Gilchrist?"
1580_141084_000013_000002 I suppose five foot six would be about it."
1580_141084_000052_000001 "Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's incident?"
1580_141084_000077_000004 I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less than that would have a chance.
1580_141084_000058_000000 Bannister's face was ghastly.
1580_141084_000024_000003 But that fellow DOES puzzle me."
1580_141084_000090_000000 "Come now, Bannister," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000008_000002 Come along, and I will personally conduct you."
1580_141084_000070_000000 "Just close the door," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000077_000000 "When I approached your room, I examined the window.
1580_141084_000078_000001 Of the centre table I could make nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper.
1580_141084_000044_000000 The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers.
1580_141084_000040_000003 Look at that!"
1580_141084_000075_000000 "Come, come," said Holmes, kindly, "it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
1580_141084_000024_000002 Pencils, too, and knives-all was satisfactory.
1580_141084_000043_000003 Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his pain."
1580_141084_000019_000000 When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows.
1580_141084_000009_000001 A tall, flaxen haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand.
1580_141084_000015_000004 I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with.
1580_141084_000039_000000 "But what fresh evidence could you have got?"
1580_141084_000082_000005 There was no possible escape.
1580_141084_000045_000003 Shall the examination proceed?"
1580_141084_000060_000001 "I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it.
1580_141084_000075_000002 Shall I do so?
1580_141084_000090_000001 "It will be clear to you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that window, it was incredible.
1580_141084_000092_000002 Come, Watson!
1580_141084_000019_000001 The Indian still paced his room.
1580_141084_000021_000000 "The foul mouthed fellow at the top.
1580_141084_000012_000000 "Can you tell me his exact height?" he asked.
1580_141084_000092_000003 As to you, sir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia.
1580_141084_000033_000000 "Certainly."
1580_141084_000031_000000 Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
1580_141084_000018_000002 I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings.
1580_141084_000009_000002 There were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within.
1580_141084_000050_000002 You there, if you please, Soames!
1580_141084_000070_000002 We can be perfectly frank with each other.
1580_141084_000044_000001 In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.
1580_141084_000074_000000 For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features.
1580_141084_000076_000000 "From the moment, mr Soames, that you said to me that no one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.
1580_141084_000069_000002 His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.
1580_141084_000028_000001 That's the puzzling part.
1580_141084_000005_000002 One of them seems restless enough."
1580_141084_000030_000001 This, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing.
1580_141084_000029_000000 There were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate.
1580_141084_000091_000005 If mr Soames saw them, the game was up.
1580_141084_000023_000000 "He looked at us in a queer way."
1580_141084_000009_000000 "No names, please!" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.
1580_141084_000018_000000 "You can be perfectly easy in your mind.
1580_141084_000076_000004 If the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they were.
1580_141084_000080_000001 He put his shoes on the table.
1580_141084_000013_000001 He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist.
1580_141084_000086_000004 You will see that I have said, 'I have determined not to go in for the examination.
1580_141084_000066_000000 "Come, come, Bannister!"
1580_141084_000050_000000 "I think so.
1580_141084_000029_000002 My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
1580_141084_000061_000000 Bannister licked his dry lips.
1580_141084_000006_000001 He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
1580_141084_000076_000006 I dismissed that.
1580_141084_000091_000004 I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message.
1580_141084_000050_000001 If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
1580_141084_000048_000000 "He shall not compete."
1580_141084_000030_000004 What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit, and that I shall share your downfall-not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students."
1580_141084_000019_000002 The others were invisible.
1580_141083_000060_000004 What about this curtain?
1580_141083_000119_000000 "Thank you, that will do," said Holmes.
1580_141083_000009_000004 I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out.
1580_141083_000066_000000 "I think it is clear enough.
1580_141083_000049_000001 Well, anyhow, that was in his mind.
1580_141083_000056_000015 Where does that door lead to?"
1580_141083_000049_000002 Let me see the three strips.
1580_141083_000004_000001 "I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police."
1580_141083_000083_000003 He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination."
1580_141083_000016_000006 Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it."
1580_141083_000018_000007 I was at my wit's end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands.
1580_141083_000074_000000 "Yes, there are."
1580_141083_000079_000000 "It is a very delicate question," said he.
1580_141083_000081_000005 He will do well.
1580_141083_000069_000001 I don't know whether you observed my bedroom window?"
1580_141083_000008_000005 I was absent rather more than an hour.
1580_141083_000009_000002 For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right.
1580_141083_000056_000006 "I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
1580_141083_000069_000000 "Surely there is another alternative, mr Holmes.
1580_141083_000049_000007 Then he tossed it down and seized the next.
1580_141083_000003_000000 "I trust, mr Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time.
1580_141083_000047_000003 I have finished with the carpet.
1580_141083_000056_000007 No, I see nothing.
1580_141083_000070_000000 "Lattice paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man."
1580_141083_000038_000000 "So it seems to me."
1580_141083_000123_000000 "Very good.
1580_141083_000056_000001 There are others.
1580_141083_000018_000000 "This was not all.
1580_141083_000071_000001 And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible.
1580_141083_000018_000008 Do help me, mr Holmes.
1580_141083_000018_000011 Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."
1580_141083_000047_000005 Of course, what has happened is very clear.
1580_141083_000025_000000 "But might be recognized as proofs?"
1580_141083_000007_000001 I am one of the examiners.
1580_141083_000037_000000 "Then it amounts to this, mr Soames: that, unless the Indian student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there."
1580_141083_000045_000001 "One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.
1580_141083_000106_000000 "Anyone in the room could get out?"
1580_141083_000016_000002 I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of the room.
1580_141083_000096_000000 "How long did you stay?"
1580_141083_000056_000010 As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it.
1580_141083_000060_000007 No one there, I suppose?"
1580_141083_000048_000000 "As a matter of fact, he could not," said Soames, "for I entered by the side door."
1580_141083_000056_000005 Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?" He held the small table sideways to the electric light.
1580_141083_000081_000003 His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf.
1580_141083_000063_000001 Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
1580_141083_000018_000001 I have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather.
1580_141083_000049_000000 "Ah, that's good!
1580_141083_000033_000000 "Where is Bannister now?"
1580_141083_000041_000003 Above were three students, one on each story.
1580_141083_000015_000000 "For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.
1580_141083_000098_000000 "Did you look at these papers on the table?"
1580_141083_000034_000002 I was in such a hurry to come to you."
1580_141083_000015_000002 The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
1580_141083_000016_000000 "Bannister was very much upset by the incident.
1580_141083_000081_000000 "I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms.
1580_141083_000072_000000 Holmes shook his head impatiently.
1580_141083_000063_000000 It was a small pyramid of black, putty like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.
1580_141083_000113_000000 "I don't know, sir, it didn't matter to me where I sat"
1580_141083_000008_000001 The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides.
1580_141083_000039_000000 Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
1580_141083_000058_000000 "Have you been in it since your adventure?"
1580_141083_000073_000000 "Let us be practical," said he.
1580_141083_000041_000006 Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
1580_141083_000110_000001 Where were you when you began to feel bad?"
1580_141083_000006_000001 Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580_141083_000082_000002 He is well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject.
1580_141083_000060_000000 "I should like to have a glance round.
1580_141083_000019_000001 "The case is not entirely devoid of interest.
1580_141083_000047_000006 The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.
1580_141083_000083_000001 He is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work-one of the brightest intellects of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled.
1580_141083_000049_000008 He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat-VERY hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
1580_141083_000008_000002 I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.
1580_141083_000045_000002 Your servant seems to have quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say.
1580_141083_000026_000000 "Possibly."
1580_141083_000045_000000 "I am afraid there are no signs here," said he.
1580_141083_000028_000000 "no"
1580_141083_000005_000003 I beg you, mr Holmes, to do what you can."
1580_141083_000040_000002 All right; come if you want to.
1580_141083_000012_000000 "The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it," said he.
1580_141083_000044_000001 We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.
1580_141083_000056_000002 What could this n n be?
1580_141083_000067_000000 "Good gracious, mr Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?"
1580_141083_000002_000002 mr Soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament.
1580_141083_000018_000003 Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long-not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.
1580_141083_000101_000001 I thought I would come back for the key. Then I forgot."
1580_141083_000041_000004 It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem.
1580_141083_000080_000001 I will look after the proofs."
1580_141083_000107_000000 "Yes, sir."
1580_141083_000114_000001 He was looking very bad-quite ghastly."
1580_141083_000013_000000 "Exactly, mr Holmes.
1580_141083_000112_000001 Why did you pass these other chairs?"
1580_141083_000041_000001 A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase.
1580_141083_000011_000000 Holmes stirred for the first time.
1580_141083_000018_000005 I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers.
1580_141083_000085_000001 But, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely."
1580_141083_000045_000003 Which chair?"
1580_141083_000017_000000 "Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
1580_141083_000030_000000 "No one save the printer."
1580_141083_000097_000000 "When I saw that he was absent, I withdrew at once."
1580_141083_000009_000001 As I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.
1580_141083_000046_000000 "By the window there."
1580_141083_000029_000000 "Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?"
1580_141083_000056_000013 It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole.
1580_141083_000056_000011 Dear me, this is very interesting.
1580_141083_000087_000002 His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.
1580_141083_000100_000000 "How came you to leave the key in the door?"
1580_141083_000001_000002 With due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.
1580_141083_000108_000000 "When mr Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?"
1580_141083_000018_000009 You see my dilemma.
1580_141083_000041_000002 On the ground floor was the tutor's room.
1580_141083_000018_000004 Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
1580_141083_000010_000001 The proof was in three long slips.
1580_141083_000016_000005 A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
1580_141083_000015_000001 He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth.
1580_141083_000082_000001 He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are.
1580_141083_000051_000000 "Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again.
1580_141083_000015_000003 A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.
1580_141083_000083_000002 He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year.
1580_141083_000051_000001 This is of interest, Watson.
1580_141083_000013_000002 How could you possibly know that?"
1580_141083_000018_000006 There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity.
1580_141083_000056_000012 And the cut-a positive tear, I see.
1580_141083_000088_000000 "We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister," said his master.
1580_141083_000040_000001 Not one of your cases, Watson-mental, not physical.
1580_141083_000024_000000 "To the best of my belief, they were rolled up."
1580_141083_000021_000000 "For which he was entered?"
1580_141083_000056_000004 You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.
1580_141083_000051_000002 The pencil was not an ordinary one.
1580_141083_000041_000005 Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window.
1580_141083_000014_000000 "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
1580_141083_000109_000002 I nearly fainted, sir."
1580_141083_000076_000000 "Yes."
1580_141083_000083_000000 "The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren.
1580_141083_000034_000001 I left him collapsed in the chair.
1580_141083_000043_000001 "Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside."
1580_141083_000117_000000 "Whom do you suspect?"
1580_141083_000006_000002 He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.
1580_141083_000031_000000 "Did this man Bannister know?"
1580_141083_000040_000003 Now, mr Soames-at your disposal!"
1580_141083_000099_000000 "No, sir-certainly not."
1580_141083_000035_000000 "You left your door open?"
1580_141083_000047_000007 He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape."
1580_141083_000047_000000 "I see.
1580_141083_000061_000001 As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.
1580_141083_000022_000000 "Yes."
1580_141083_000095_000000 "It was about half past four.
1580_141083_000044_000000 The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room.
1580_141083_000057_000000 "To my bedroom."
1580_141083_000094_000000 "When did you enter the room?"
1580_141083_000010_000002 I had left them all together.
1580_141083_000081_000001 The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump.
1580_141083_000049_000004 Well, he carried over this one first, and he copied it.
1580_141083_000056_000003 It is at the end of a word.
1580_141083_000008_000000 "To day, about three o'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers.
1580_141083_000079_000001 "One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs."
1580_141083_000042_000001 There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.
1580_141083_000008_000004 I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk.
1580_141083_000010_000000 "The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
1580_141083_000078_000000 Soames hesitated.
1580_141083_000007_000000 "I must explain to you, mr Holmes, that to morrow is the first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship.
1580_141083_000071_000002 The man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally, finding the door open, have escaped that way."
1580_141083_000054_000000 "You see?"
1580_141083_000086_000000 "Exactly.
1580_141083_000036_000000 "I locked up the papers first."
1580_141083_000085_000000 "I dare not go so far as that.
1580_141083_000065_000000 "What could he have wanted there?"
1580_141083_000093_000000 "It was most unfortunate, sir.
1580_141083_000006_000000 My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580_141083_000066_000002 What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself."
1580_141083_000042_000000 "He must have entered through the door.
1580_141083_000018_000002 I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained.
1580_141083_000071_000000 "Exactly.
1580_141083_000101_000000 "I had the tea tray in my hand.
1580_141083_000016_000003 I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers.
1580_141083_000090_000000 "I understand," said Holmes, "that you left your key in the door?"
1580_141083_000081_000004 My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious.
1580_141083_000123_000001 Now, mr Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please."
1580_141083_000016_000004 On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened.
1580_141083_000047_000004 Let us take the little table first.
1580_141083_000040_000000 "Well," said he, "let us go round.
908_31957_000011_000001 Shall I never miss Home talk and blessing and the common kiss That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange, When I look up, to drop on a new range Of walls and floors, another home than this? Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change That's hardest.
908_31957_000008_000000 thirty four
908_31957_000017_000001 A ring of amethyst I could not wear here, plainer to my sight, Than that first kiss.
908_31957_000023_000002 Oh, to shoot My soul's full meaning into future years, That they should lend it utterance, and salute Love that endures, from life that disappears!
908_31957_000003_000000 Thou comest!
908_31957_000017_000002 The second passed in height The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed, Half falling on the hair.
908_31957_000018_000000 thirty nine
908_31957_000010_000000 thirty five
908_31957_000007_000000 Yes, call me by my pet name! let me hear The name I used to run at, when a child, From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied, To glance up in some face that proved me dear With the look of its eyes.
908_31957_000012_000000 thirty six
908_31957_000013_000000 When we met first and loved, I did not build Upon the event with marble.
908_31957_000002_000000 thirty one
908_31957_000013_000002 Nay, I rather thrilled, Distrusting every light that seemed to gild The onward path, and feared to overlean A finger even.
908_31957_000007_000001 I miss the clear Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled Into the music of Heaven's undefiled, Call me no longer.
908_31957_000021_000002 Polypheme's white tooth Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers, The shell is over smooth,--and not so much Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate Or else to oblivion.
908_31957_000003_000002 Behold, I erred In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue The sin most, but the occasion-that we two Should for a moment stand unministered By a mutual presence.
908_31957_000011_000000 If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange And be all to me?
908_31957_000025_000001 Then I, long tried By natural ills, received the comfort fast, While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled. I seek no copy now of life's first half: Leave here the pages with long musing curled, And write me new my future's epigraph, New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!
908_31957_000003_000001 all is said without a word. I sit beneath thy looks, as children do In the noon sun, with souls that tremble through Their happy eyelids from an unaverred Yet prodigal inward joy.
908_31957_000019_000001 Dearest, teach me so To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!
908_31957_000006_000000 thirty three
908_157963_000029_000000 But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast. And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away. But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.
908_157963_000034_000000 She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning Dolors and lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground, Till to her own grave plot she came, and there she sat down. And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
908_157963_000026_000001 I see they lay helpless and naked: weeping And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.
908_157963_000010_000001 born but to smile and fall. Ah!
908_157963_000020_000000 Dost thou O little cloud?
908_157963_000036_000000 Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind? Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in? Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy? Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?
908_157963_000010_000000 O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water? Why fade these children of the spring?
908_157963_000024_000000 three.
908_157963_000004_000000 Does the Eagle know what is in the pit? Or wilt thou go ask the Mole: Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod? Or Love in a golden bowl?
4992_41806_000029_000001 "It was kind of you to spend so much time in our behalf."
4992_41806_000010_000001 Then Nancy handed peter a loosely bound sheaf, saying: "To light this fire I give you a torch.
4992_41806_000017_000003 Underneath it we lay a posy of pressed daisies, buttercups, and Queen Anne's lace, the wild flowers she loved best."
4992_41806_000028_000000 "I've seen this thing layin' in the barn chamber in a thousand pieces all summer!" explained mr Popham radiantly.
4992_41806_000003_000004 They began with the one in the family sitting room; Colonel Wheeler, Ralph Thurston, mr and mrs Bill Harmon with Natty and Rufus, mr and mrs Popham with Digby and Lallie Joy, all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events.
4992_41806_000022_000000 "Ain't they the greatest?" murmured Lallie Joy, turning to her father, but he had disappeared from the group.
4992_41806_000032_000002 He always slipped up his glasses during this performance and closed his eyes, but neither grey hairs nor "specs" could dim the radiant smile that made him seem about fifteen years old and the junior of both his children.
4992_41806_000007_000000 Mother Carey spoke these words so simply and naturally, as she looked towards her neighbors one after another, with her hand resting on Peter's curly head, that they hardly knew whether to keep quiet or say Amen.
4992_41806_000001_000000 THE CAREY HOUSEWARMING
4992_41806_000017_000001 Mother Carey's bedroom, with its bouquets of field flowers on the wall paper, was gaily lighted and ready to receive the gift.
4992_41806_000024_000001 "We cannot be happy without mr Popham."
4992_41806_000008_000000 "Was that the Bible, Osh?" whispered Bill Harmon.
4992_41806_000027_000000 The guests naturally had no associations with the Carey Curse, and the Careys themselves were dumb with amazement and despair.
4992_41806_000009_000000 "Don't know; 'most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me."
4992_41806_000036_000000 "We shut our eyes, the flowers bloom on; We murmur, but the corn ears fill; We choose the shadow, but the sun That casts it shines behind us still."
4992_41806_000002_000000 The housewarming was at its height, and everybody agreed once in every ten minutes that it was probably the most beautiful party that had ever happened in the history of the world.
4992_41806_000034_000003 The tall silver candle sticks gleamed in the firelight, the silver dish of polished Baldwins blushed rosier in the glow.
4992_41806_000003_000002 The stove in the cellar, always alluded to by Gilbert as the "young furnace," had not yet been used, save by way of experiment, but it was believed to be a perfect success.
4992_41806_000032_000000 It was as cheery, gay, festive, neighborly, and friendly a supper as ever took place in the dining room of the Yellow House, although Governor Weatherby may have had some handsomer banquets in his time. When it was over all made their way into the rosy, bowery, summer parlor.
4992_41806_000003_000003 To night there was no need of extra heat, and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones.
4992_41806_000025_000001 Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth.
4992_41806_000010_000002 In it are herbs of the field for health of the body, a fern leaf for grace, a sprig of elm for peace, one of oak for strength, with evergreen to show that we live forever in the deeds we have done.
4992_41806_000014_000000 Next came Olive's turn to help in the ceremonies.
4992_41806_000034_000001 The face of the mahogany shone with delight, and why not, when it was doing everything (almost everything!) within the scope of a piano, and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions.
4992_41806_000014_000002 Olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas, and, giving it to mr Popham, stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it. The family had feared that he would tell a good story when he found himself the centre of attraction, but he was as dumb as peter, and for the same reason.
4992_41806_000020_000001 Thou who settest the solitary in families, bless the life that is sheltered here.
4992_41806_000034_000000 Last of all the entire company gathered round the old-fashioned piano for a parting hymn.
4992_41806_000026_000000 It was the Dirty Boy, carefully mended!
4992_41806_000011_000000 peter crouched on the hearth and lighted the fire in three places, then handed the torch to Kathleen as he crept again into his mother's lap, awed into complete silence by the influence of his own mystic rite. Kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night.
4992_41806_000020_000002 Grant that trust and peace and comfort may abide within, and that love and light and usefulness may go out from this house forever.
4992_41806_000003_000000 Water flowed freely through Cousin Ann's expensive pipes, that had been buried so deep in their trenches that the winter frosts could not affect them.
4992_41806_000034_000005 The Careys all sang like thrushes, and even peter, holding his hymn book upside down, put in little bird notes, always on the key, whenever he caught a familiar strain.
4992_41806_000023_000001 Mother Carey poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, doughnuts and tarts.
4992_41806_000032_000001 Soon another fire sparkled and snapped on the hearth, and there were songs and poems and choruses and Osh Popham's fiddle, to say nothing of the supreme event of the evening, his rendition of "Fly like a youthful hart or roe, over the hills where spices grow," to Mother Carey's accompaniment.
4992_41806_000035_000000 "Once more the liberal year laughs out O'er richer stores than gems or gold; Once more, with harvest song and shout Is Nature's bloodless triumph told."
4992_41806_000029_000000 "Thank you, mr Popham!" said mrs Carey, her eyes twinkling as she looked at the laughing children.
4992_41806_000034_000004 Mother Carey played the dear old common metre tune, and the voices rang out in Whittier's hymn.
4992_41806_000017_000000 Gilbert, at the head of the procession, held Mother Hamilton's picture, which had been taken from the old brick oven where "my son Tom" had hidden it.
4992_41806_000003_000001 Natty Harmon tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening, for the water had to run up hill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink, and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might "give out" at any moment.
4992_23283_000040_000000 The rapid emotion of varying passions, which immediately darted over his features, informed Miss Woodley that her secret was discovered-she hid her face, while the tears that fell down to her bosom, confirmed the truth of his suggestion, beyond what oaths could have done.
4992_23283_000023_000002 Yet I cannot but lament that I am not as well informed as you are.
4992_23283_000019_000000 "Perhaps I am mistaken," answered she.
4992_23283_000039_000003 Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.
4992_23283_000034_000001 You talk mysteriously.
4992_23283_000004_000000 Lord Elmwood laid down the newspaper to attend to her.
4992_23283_000052_000000 Miss Woodley was going to say something farther, but as if incapable of attending to her, he hastened out of the room.
4992_23283_000027_000000 "Why so?" said he, warmly.
4992_23283_000023_000003 I wish to prove my friendship to Miss Milner, but she will not suffer me-and every step that I take for her happiness, I take in the most perplexing uncertainty."
4992_23283_000042_000001 Miss Woodley was too little versed in the subject, to know, this would have been not to love at all; at least, not to the extent of breaking through engagements, and all the various obstacles that still militated against their union.
4992_23283_000045_000000 "I will make no unjust use of what I know," he replied with firmness.
4992_23283_000051_000000 "We are not judges of what belongs to ourselves," he replied-"I am transported at the tidings you have revealed, and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."
4992_23283_000050_000000 "But she would account it an injury."
4992_23283_000031_000000 "Great as my friendship is, there are certainly bounds to it-bounds that shall save her in spite of herself:"--and he raised his voice.
4992_23283_000006_000000 "So there is to me!" added Sandford, with a sarcastic sneer.
4992_23283_000025_000001 I am not only proper from character, but from circumstances, to be relied upon-my interest is so nearly connected with the interest, and my happiness with the happiness of my ward, that those principles, as well as my honour, would protect her against every peril arising from my being trusted."
4992_23283_000034_000002 Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations?"
4992_23283_000043_000001 To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and said, "Do you believe me?"
4992_23283_000047_000001 They are confused-they are triumphant at present.
4992_23283_000047_000002 I have never yet, however, been vanquished by them; and even upon this occasion, my reason shall combat them to the last-and my reason shall fail me, before I do wrong."
4992_23283_000003_000000 "Miss Milner's health is not good!" said mrs Horton a few minutes after.
4992_23283_000033_000000 "My Lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one; it is but too refined."
4992_23283_000012_000000 "I am glad to hear it," he returned quickly; "for although I am not of a suspicious nature, yet in regard to her affections for him, I cannot but still have my doubts."
4992_23283_000048_000000 He was going to leave the room-she followed him, and cried, "But, my Lord, how shall I see again the unhappy object of my treachery?"
4992_23283_000043_000000 Lord Elmwood was sensible of the embarrassment his presence gave Miss Woodley, and understood the reproaches which she seemed to vent upon herself in silence.
4992_23283_000002_000002 Sandford shook his head.
4992_23283_000041_000000 "For God's sake take care what you are doing-you are destroying my prospects of futurity-you are making this world too dear to me."
4992_23283_000036_000000 "Then must the person be unworthy of her."
4992_23283_000047_000000 "But for what my passions now dictate," continued he, "I will not answer.
4992_23283_000034_000000 "What can you mean by that, Miss Woodley?
4992_23283_000010_000000 "I think, Miss Woodley, Miss Milner was extremely to blame, though I did not chuse to tell her so before mr Sandford, in giving Lord Frederick an opportunity of speaking to her, unless she means that he shall renew his addresses."
4992_41797_000016_000001 Her only interests in life were her younger brother Cyril, delicate and timid, and in continual terror of his father,--and a passion for drawing and sketching that was fairly devouring in its intensity.
4992_41797_000009_000000 "Doctor of what?" asked mrs Carey.
4992_41797_000012_000002 "If you don't work hard you can't keep up with the times!
4992_41797_000015_000000 mr Popham exaggerated nothing, but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the House of Lords.
4992_41797_000004_000003 A grove of poplars to the left of it only made the prospect more depressing, and if it had not been for a great sheet of water near by, floating with cow lilies and pond lilies, the whole aspect of the place would have been unspeakably dreary.
4992_41797_000008_000002 Not that I could make a better one!
4992_41797_000025_000000 A few moments later Nancy entered her mother's room, her arms filled with treasures from the woods and fields.
4992_41797_000018_000000 "You'd better give her lessons in self control," mr Lord answered. "They are cheaper than instruction in drawing, and much more practical."
4992_41797_000020_000001 "And people paint fruit, and dead fish on platters, and pitchers of lemonade with ice in,--why don't you try things like those?"
4992_41797_000017_000002 She makes effort after effort, trembling with eagerness, and when she fails to reproduce what she sees, she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment."
4992_41797_000004_000000 The Carey children had only found it by accident.
4992_41797_000014_000002 He keeps the thou shalt not commandments first rate, Hen Lord does!
4992_41797_000010_000001 I wouldn't trust him to doctor a sick cat."
4992_41797_000025_000007 There never was anybody needed you so much as she does,--never."
4992_41797_000013_000000 "What has he done to make him so unpopular?" queried mrs Carey.
4992_41797_000006_000000 "You won't never see nothin' of 'em," said mr Popham.
4992_41797_000025_000003 She's wonderful!
4992_41797_000025_000006 Oh, mother, there's always so much spare room in your heart,--for you took in Julia and yet we never felt the difference,--won't you make a place for Olive?
4992_41797_000010_000000 "Blamed if I know!
4992_41797_000026_000000 Have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale, yellow, stunted shoots of grass under it?
4992_41797_000014_000003 He neglected his wife and froze her blood and frightened her to death, poor little shadder!
4992_41797_000023_000004 Her hand, so marvellously full of skill, had never held another's, and she was desperately self conscious; but magnetism flowed from Nancy as electric currents from a battery.
4992_41797_000021_000000 "I suppose they're easier," Olive returned with a sigh, "but who could bear to do them when there are living, breathing, moving things; things that puzzle you by looking different every minute?
4992_41797_000024_000002 Nancy's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun, and Olive's thick black plaits looked blacker by contrast.
4992_41797_000023_000002 But Nancy Carey, never shy, and as eager to give herself as people always are who are born and bred in joy and love, Nancy hopped out of Mother Carey's warm nest one day, and fixing her bright eyes and sunny, hopeful glance on the lonely, frowning little neighbor, stretched out her hand in friendship.
4992_41797_000012_000000 mr Popham laid down his brush.
4992_41797_000019_000001 She worked, discovering laws and making rules for herself, since she had no helpers. When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look "real" on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
4992_41797_000025_000005 She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
4992_41797_000024_000000 The first interview, purely a casual one, took place on the edge of the lily pond where Olive was sketching frogs, and where Nancy went for cat o'-nine tails.
4992_41797_000015_000002 Always irritable, cold, indifferent, he had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992_41797_000007_000000 "Is the mother dead?" mrs Carey asked.
4992_41797_000023_000001 Her gloomy young heart was visited by frequent storms and she looked as unlovable as she was unloved.
4992_41797_000015_000001 Henry Lord, with the degree of p h d to his credit, had been Professor of Zoology at a New England college, but had resigned his post in order to write a series of scientific text books.
4992_41797_000020_000000 "Why don't you do flowers and houses, Olive?" inquired Cyril solicitously.
4992_41797_000019_000003 O! Cyril, there must be some better way of doing; I just draw the outline of an animal and then I put hairs or feathers on it.
4992_41797_000008_000001 It's an awful queer world!
4992_41797_000016_000000 A lonelier creature than Olive Lord at sixteen could hardly be imagined. She was a tiny thing for her years, with a little white oval face and peaked chin, pronounced eyebrows, beautifully arched, and a mass of tangled, untidy dark hair.
4992_41797_000004_000002 One afternoon Nancy and Kathleen had walked up the road in search of pastures new, and had spied down in a distant hollow a gloomy grey house almost surrounded by cedars.
4992_41797_000002_000000 eighteen
4992_41797_000017_000001 "She is wild to know how to do things.
4992_41797_000019_000005 They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard."
4992_41797_000014_000000 "Done?
4992_41797_000016_000004 Then for the three years before her mother's death there had been surreptitious lessons from a Portland teacher, paid for out of mr Lord's house allowance; for one of his chief faults was an incredible parsimony, amounting almost to miserliness.
4992_41797_000016_000003 Whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas.
4992_41797_000015_000004 Then the poor little shadow of a woman dropped wearily into her grave, and a certain elderly mrs Bangs, with grey hair and firm chin, came to keep house and do the work.
4992_41797_000019_000004 They have no bodies.
4992_41797_000024_000001 It proved to be a long and intimate talk, and when mrs Carey looked out of her bedroom window just before supper she saw, at the pasture bars, the two girls with their arms round each other and their cheeks close together.
4992_41797_000011_000000 "People don't have to be doctors of medicine," interrupted Gilbert. "Grandfather was Alexander Carey, l l.D.,--Doctor of Laws, that is."
8224_274384_000022_000001 Two important points remained to be settled with that nation: their delivery of the king, and the estimation of their arrears.
8224_274384_000017_000000 The parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king.
8224_274384_000037_000000 During the time that the king remained in the Scottish army at Newcastle, died the earl of Essex, the discarded, but still powerful and popular general of the parliament.
8224_274384_000005_000009 Another preacher, after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment, ordered this psalm to be sung:--
8224_274384_000014_000000 They required him to issue orders to Oxford and to all his other garrisons, commanding their surrender to the parliament; and the king, sensible that their resistance was to very little purpose, willingly complied.
8224_274384_000018_000001 He requested a personal treaty with the parliament.
8224_274384_000030_000000 The infamy of this bargain had such an influence on the Scottish parliament, that they once voted that the king should be protected, and his liberty insisted on.
8224_274384_000031_000001 The English commissioners, who, some days after, came to take him under their custody, were admitted to kiss his hands; and he received them with the same grace and cheerfulness as if they had travelled on no other errand than to pay court to him.
8224_274384_000029_000000 Thus the Scottish nation underwent, and still undergo, (for such grievous stains are not easily wiped off,) the reproach of selling their king and betraying their prince for money.
8224_274384_000000_000001 He rode before a portmanteau, and called himself Ashburnham's servant.
8224_274384_000006_000000 "Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself, Thy wicked deeds to praise?"
8224_274384_000005_000006 or hath he given us any gift?
8224_274384_000037_000001 His death, in this conjuncture, was a public misfortune.
8224_274384_000010_000002 The Scottish generals would enter into no confidence with him; and still treated him with distant ceremony and feigned respect.
8224_274384_000022_000000 What the parliament was most intent upon, was not their treaty with the king, to whom they paid little regard, but that with the Scots.
8224_274384_000001_000001 They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident, and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king.
8224_274384_000015_000001 Montrose also, after having experienced still more variety of good and bad fortune, threw down his arms, and retired out of the kingdom.
8224_274384_000016_000000 The marquis of Worcester, a man past eighty four, was the last in England that submitted to the authority of the parliament.
8224_274384_000026_000002 And though the contributions which they had levied, as well as the price of their living at free quarters, must be deducted, yet still the sum which they insisted on was very considerable.
8224_274384_000017_000002 Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of Naseby.
8224_274384_000017_000001 They were such as a captive, entirely at mercy, could expect from the most inexorable victor.
8224_274384_000032_000001 On his journey, the whole country flocked to behold him, moved partly by curiosity, partly by compassion and affection.
8224_274384_000001_000000 The Scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king; and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity, they instantly set a guard upon him, under color of protection, and made him in reality a prisoner.
8224_274384_000037_000002 Fully sensible of the excesses to which affairs had been carried, and of the worse consequences which were still to be apprehended, he had resolved to conciliate a peace, and to remedy, as far as possible, all those ills to which, from mistake rather than any bad intentions, he had himself so much contributed.
8224_274384_000028_000000 Great pains were taken by the Scots (and the English complied with their pretended delicacy) to make this estimation and payment of arrears appear a quite different transaction from that for the delivery of the king's person: but common sense requires that they should be regarded as one and the same.
8224_274384_000036_000001 The parliament, though earnestly applied to by the king, refused to allow his chaplains to attend him, because they had not taken the covenant.
8224_274384_000005_000001 He was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers, on whom all depended.
8224_274384_000005_000005 Have we eaten at all of the king's cost?
8224_274384_000016_000001 He defended Raglan Castle to extremity; and opened not its gates till the middle of August.
7021_79730_000047_000001 Government by Manoeuvring and Artifice.
7021_79730_000049_000000 three.
7021_79730_000067_000001 But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
7021_79730_000065_000004 And a child who never, from the beginning, finds any efficiency in them, never learns to employ them at all.
7021_79730_000056_000000 "Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too.
7021_79730_000055_000001 The theory of many mothers is that they must govern their children by the influence of reason and affection.
7021_79730_000047_000000 one.
7021_79730_000044_000003 The object of this work is, accordingly, not to show how the gentle methods which will be brought to view can be employed as a substitute for such authority, but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it.
7021_79730_000061_000000 "Why can't you take me?" asks Mary.
7021_79730_000065_000003 A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
7021_79730_000052_000000 As the chaise drives away, Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step, her mind in a tumult of excitement, in which hatred of the doctor, distrust and suspicion of her mother, disappointment, vexation, and ill humor, surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend-doing perhaps an irreparable injury.
7021_79730_000059_000001 By the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority.
7021_79730_000046_000001 They are,
7021_79730_000063_000000 Then, if she observes any expression of discontent or insubmission in Mary's countenance, the mother would add,
7021_79730_000053_000000 In respect to her statement that she was going to the doctor's, it may, or may not, have been true.
7021_79730_000043_000000 THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT.
7021_79730_000056_000003 Then I shall love you, and your papa will love you, and after I get well we will take you to ride with us some day."
7021_79730_000060_000000 "Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am sorry, for your sake, that we can not take you with us."
7021_79730_000046_000000 There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
7021_79730_000056_000002 You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
7021_79730_000062_000000 "I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
7021_79730_000051_000003 She brings down her bonnet and shawl by stealth, and before the chaise comes to the door she sends Mary out into the garden with her sister, under pretense of showing her a bird's nest which is not there, trusting to her sister's skill in diverting the child's mind, and amusing her with something else in the garden, until the chaise has gone.
7021_79730_000065_000002 Those children only attempt to carry their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find, by experience, that such measures are usually successful.
7021_79730_000051_000001 Many mothers manage their children by means of tricks and contrivances, more or less adroit, designed to avoid direct issues with them, and to beguile them, as it were, into compliance with their wishes.
7021_79730_000048_000001 By Reason and Affection.
7021_79730_000057_000000 The mother, in managing the case in this way, relies partly on convincing the reason of the child, and partly on an appeal to her affection.
7021_79730_000049_000001 By Authority.
7021_79730_000044_000001 To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
7021_79759_000009_000003 Every strong impression which you make upon his perceptive powers must have a very lasting influence, and even the impression itself may, in some cases, be forever indelible.
7021_79759_000008_000001 Thus they seem to constitute more than the mere furniture of the mind; they form, as it were, almost a part of the structure itself.
7021_79759_000004_000005 The images which have been awakened in her mind, the emotions connected with them, and the effect of these images and emotions upon her faculties of imagination and conception, will infuse a life into them which will make her, in respect to this aspect of her spiritual nature, a different being as long as she lives.
7021_79759_000008_000000 For the ideas and generalizations thus mainly formed from the images and impressions received in childhood become, in later years, the elements of the machinery, so to speak, by which all his mental operations are performed.
7021_79759_000006_000001 They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
7021_79759_000001_000000 CONCLUSION.
7021_79759_000006_000003 Every story, therefore, which you relate to a child to exemplify the principles of justice or goodness takes its place, or, rather, the impression which it makes takes its place, as one of the elements out of which the ideas that are to govern his future life are formed.
7021_79759_000004_000004 You have made a life-long change, if not in the very structure, at least in the permanent furnishing of her mind, and performed a work that can never by any possibility be undone.
7021_79759_000009_000001 The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
7021_79759_000010_000002 We can not surrender this trust.
7021_85628_000026_000001 He only shook his head.
7021_85628_000016_000000 "Where may you be going?" asked one of the soldiers.
7021_85628_000013_000001 She called him a little gentleman and said that he was so fine that he might go to the royal court ball.
7021_85628_000025_000000 "Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
7021_85628_000002_000000 Once upon a time there was a little boy, called Anders, who had a new cap.
7021_85628_000021_000001 For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021_85628_000027_000000 "Well, but now?" said the Princess; and she filled his pockets with cakes, and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck, and bent down and kissed him.
7021_85628_000019_000000 But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
7021_85628_000032_000000 "So it is," said Anders.
7021_85628_000012_000000 And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
7021_85628_000008_000000 At the turn of the road he ran up against the tanner's boy, Lars.
7021_85628_000005_000000 The first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse.
7021_85628_000033_000000 "But surely you would like to change caps with me," said the King, and raised his large, heavy gold crown from his head.
7021_85628_000041_000001 "If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
7021_85628_000035_000001 He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7021_85628_000035_000003 He ran so fast that the Princess's necklace fell off his neck, and all the cakes jumped out of his pockets.
7021_85628_000036_000001 And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
7021_85628_000042_000000 Then Anders felt brave again.
7021_85628_000034_000001 He sat as before, and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get.
7021_85628_000039_000000 "Mother, was I stupid?"
7021_85628_000009_000000 "Let's swap caps," he said, "and I will give you my jack knife to boot."
7021_85628_000037_000000 But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
7021_85628_000042_000001 He knew well enough that mother's cap was the best cap in all the world.
7021_85628_000026_000000 The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
7021_85628_000010_000000 Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
7021_85628_000019_000001 When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
7021_85628_000035_000002 He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
7021_85628_000004_000000 His brothers and sisters walked about squinting at him, and their faces grew long with envy.
7021_85628_000015_000001 In the palace yard stood two soldiers with shining helmets, and with muskets over their shoulders; and when Anders came, both the muskets were levelled at him.
7021_85628_000020_000000 "Oh," she said, "he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head, that that will do just as well as a uniform."
7021_85628_000002_000001 And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
7021_85628_000008_000001 He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife. He gazed and gazed at the cap, and could not keep from fingering the blue tassel.
7021_85628_000018_000000 "Indeed you are not," said the other soldier, and put his foot forward.
7021_85628_000004_000001 But Anders cared nothing about that.
7021_85628_000004_000002 He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
7021_85628_000038_000001 That he had not thought of.
7021_85628_000006_000000 "Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
7021_85628_000017_000000 "I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
7021_85628_000036_000000 And his mother took him up in her lap, and he told her all his adventures, and how everybody wanted his cap.
7021_85628_000040_000000 But his mother hugged him close.
7021_85628_000029_000000 Then the doors were thrown open, and the King entered with a large suite of gentlemen in glittering uniforms and plumed hats.
7021_85628_000031_000000 "That is a very fine cap you have," he said.
7021_85628_000015_000000 And so he did.
7021_85628_000022_000000 At the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.
7021_85628_000022_000001 On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
7021_85628_000035_000000 With one jump Anders got out of his chair.
7021_85628_000005_000001 He made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking, and he was dumbfounded, I can tell you, when he saw it was nobody but Anders.
7021_85628_000030_000000 He smiled when he saw Anders in the gilt chair.
7021_85628_000032_000001 "And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
7021_85628_000022_000002 The Princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses; and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
7021_85628_000014_000000 "Yes, why not?" thought Anders.
7021_85628_000007_000000 But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
7021_85628_000034_000000 Anders did not answer.
7021_85628_000035_000004 But he had his cap. He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
7021_85628_000014_000001 "Seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the King."
7021_85628_000023_000000 "But you must not eat with your cap on your head," she said, and was going to take it off.
7021_85628_000038_000002 He cuddled up to his mother and asked:
7021_79740_000020_000005 Put these playthings all away quick, and carefully, and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out."
7021_79740_000005_000001 Besides dressing and undressing them, and playing take them out to excursions and visits, they used to talk with them a great deal, and give them much useful and valuable information and instruction.
7021_79740_000015_000002 Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
7021_79740_000009_000001 If Delia had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves, they would very soon have become restless and uneasy, and it would have made very little impression upon them.
7021_79740_000010_000006 I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
7021_79740_000022_000000 Besides, a scolding would have made them unhappy, and this did not make them unhappy at all; it amused and entertained them.
7021_79740_000019_000000 So saying, she led the way on tiptoe, followed by the children out of the room, and round by a circuitous route to the piazza.
7021_79740_000010_000000 "How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
7021_79740_000003_000000 This book may, perhaps, sometimes fall into the hands of persons who have, temporarily or otherwise, the charge of young children without any absolute authority over them, or any means, or even any right, to enforce their commands, as was the case, in fact, with the older brothers or sister referred to in the preceding illustrations.
7021_79740_000022_000001 If you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it, there is a double gain.
7021_79740_000010_000003 You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
7021_79740_000021_000001 And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
7021_79740_000010_000004 I am very glad.
7021_79740_000010_000005 You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
7021_79740_000020_000003 They would think that they might do so too, and that would make you a great deal of trouble.
7021_79740_000017_000000 Delia was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction, but sometimes for reproof, in many ingenious ways.
7021_79740_000002_000000 DELLA AND THE DOLLS.
7021_79740_000013_000002 And you don't look very well now.
7021_79740_000017_000002 They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
7021_79740_000009_000002 But being addressed to the dolls, they would be greatly interested in it, and would listen with the utmost attention; and there is no doubt that the counsels and instructions which she gave made a much stronger impression upon their minds than if they had been addressed directly to the children themselves. To give an idea of these conversations I will report one of them in full.
7021_79740_000020_000002 I would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration.
7021_79740_000018_000001 I want you to come with me.
7021_79740_000021_000000 So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
7021_79740_000011_000000 Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "Has she been a good girl, Jane?"
7021_79740_000003_000001 To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
7021_79740_000020_000000 "There!" said she, pointing to the playthings; "see! all your playthings left out!
7021_79740_000020_000001 Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them.
7021_79740_000017_000001 For instance, one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings, and finally had gone into the house, leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza, instead of putting them away in their places, as they ought to have done.
7021_79740_000007_000000 Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
7021_79740_000003_000002 Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
7021_79740_000018_000002 There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account."
7021_79740_000010_000002 How nice you look!
7021_79740_000013_000000 "Ah!" said Della in a tone of great concern, and looking again at Andella, "I heard that you had been sick.
1188_133604_000042_000001 But look here at Carpaccio, even in my copy.
1188_133604_000023_000000 Again, there is not a touch of black in any shadow, however deep, of these two studies; so that, if I chose to put a piece of black near them, it would be conspicuous with a vengeance.
1188_133604_000033_000000 Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.
1188_133604_000055_000000 in a few moments to lose her forever.
1188_133604_000046_000005 He knows them both.
1188_133604_000011_000002 By being studious of color they are studious of division; and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing-unseparated light, the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light.
1188_133604_000040_000002 But if you go on into the veracities of the school of Clay, you will find there is something at the roots of almond and apple trees, which is-This.
1188_133604_000045_000001 So that if you get once the right clue to any group of them, it will grasp the simplest, yet reach to the highest truths.
1188_133604_000048_000003 Thus, in Chaucer's "Dream":
1188_133604_000038_000003 But this peacock, being drawn with intense delight in blue, on gold, and getting character of peacock in the general sharp outline, instead of-as Rubens' peacocks-in black shadow, is distinctively Gothic of fine style.
1188_133604_000046_000003 Well, then, last, here is Turner's; Greek school of the highest class; and you define his art, absolutely, as first the displaying intensely, and with the sternest intellect, of natural form as it is, and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire.
1188_133604_000012_000002 My first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance, on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side.
1188_133604_000011_000003 And therefore, primarily, they must be able to divide; so that elementary exercises in color must be directed, like first exercises in music, to the clear separation of notes; and the final perfections of color are those in which, of innumerable notes or hues, every one has a distinct office, and can be fastened on by the eye, and approved, as fulfilling it.
1188_133604_000028_000003 George" of Carpaccio at Venice, are all that I can name myself of great works.
1188_133604_000039_000004 None of this bright Gothic art was ever done but either by faith in the attainableness of felicity in heaven, or under conditions of real order and delicate loveliness on the earth.
1188_133604_000039_000002 But, observe, you can only do this on one condition-that of striving also to create, in reality, the beauty which you seek in imagination.
1188_133604_000018_000000 Then he comes to the beak of it.
1188_133604_000067_000002 And here I am able to show you, fortunately, one of his works painted at this time of his most earnest thought; when his imagination was still freshly filled with the Greek mythology, and he saw for the first time with his own eyes the clouds come down upon the actual earth.
1188_133604_000048_000000 Now in this of Burne Jones, the landscape is clearly full of light everywhere, color or glass light: that is, the outline is prepared for modification of color only.
1188_133604_000036_000004 Our uneducated men work too bluntly to be ever in the right; but the Germans draw finely and resolutely wrong.
1188_133604_000018_000002 There are just four touches-fine as the finest penmanship-to do that beak; and yet you will find that in the peculiar paroquettish mumbling and nibbling action of it, and all the character in which this nibbling beak differs from the tearing beak of the eagle, it is impossible to go farther or be more precise.
1188_133604_000061_000006 It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness; and all its lines are cramped and poor.
1188_133604_000012_000003 Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds, so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge.
1188_133604_000031_000001 I fully anticipated, at the beginning of the Pre Raphaelite movement, that they would have carried forward this method of work; but they broke themselves to pieces by pursuing dramatic sensation instead of beauty.
1188_133604_000057_000001 I just now referred to the landscape by john Bellini in the National Gallery as one of the six best existing of the purist school, being wholly felicitous and enjoyable.
1188_133604_000024_000001 You have the white of foaming water, of buildings and clouds, brought out brilliantly from a white ground; and though part of the subject is in deep shadow the eye at once catches the one black point admitted in front.
1188_133604_000012_000004 And one of the chief delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in that art as distinct from sculpture is in this exquisite inlaying or joiner's work of it, the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill precisely correspondent to the close application of crowded notes without the least slur, in fine harp or piano playing.
1188_133604_000060_000003 Once understand that, and you will see why Turner has put her death under this deep shade of trees, the sun withdrawing his last ray; and why he has put beside her the low type of an animal's pain, a dog licking its wounded paw.
1188_133604_000021_000003 Of course, I cannot do so myself; yet in these sketches of mine, made for the sake of color, there is enough to show you the nature and the value of the method. They are two pieces of study of the color of marble architecture, the tints literally "edified," and laid edge to edge as simply on the paper as the stones are on the walls.
1188_133604_000040_000003 You must look at him in the face-fight him-conquer him with what scathe you may: you need not think to keep out of the way of him.
1188_133604_000039_000001 I wish you therefore to begin your study of natural history and landscape by discerning the simple outlines and the pleasant colors of things; and to rest in them as long as you can.
1188_133604_000042_000003 And also, Carpaccio does it with a touch, with one sweep of his brush; three minutes at the most allowed for all the beast; while Michael Angelo has been haggling at this dragon's neck for an hour.
1188_133604_000033_000001 You might more easily fill a house with pictures like Constable's from garret to cellar, than imitate one cluster of leaves by Van Eyck or Giotto; and among all the efforts that have been made to paint our common wild flowers, I have only once-and that in this very year, just in time to show it to you-seen the thing done rightly.
1188_133604_000061_000002 In both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful.
1188_133604_000004_000005 You see how doubly, how intimately, opposed the ideas are; yet how difficult to explain without apparent contradiction.
1188_133604_000028_000004 But there exist some exquisite, though feebler, designs in missal painting; of which, in England, the landscape and flowers in the Psalter of Henry the Sixth will serve you for a sufficient type; the landscape in the Grimani missal at Venice being monumentally typical and perfect.
1188_133604_000055_000001 The other is a mythological subject of deeper meaning, the death of Procris.
1188_133604_000006_000000 So that the schools of Crystal, visionary, passionate, and fantastic in purpose, are, in method, trenchantly formal and clear; and the schools of Clay, absolutely realistic, temperate, and simple in purpose, are, in method, mysterious and soft; sometimes licentious, sometimes terrific, and always obscure.
1188_133604_000050_000003 In both, the vegetation, though beautiful, is absolutely wild and uncared for, as it seems, either by human or by higher powers, which, having appointed for it the laws of its being, leave it to spring into such beauty as is consistent with disease and alternate with decay.
1188_133604_000026_000001 I say, "whether color be gay or sad."
1188_133604_000046_000004 Only, there are two sorts of cloud and fire.
1188_133604_000045_000000 Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study of art, than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter.
1188_133604_000030_000001 Now for your own practice in this, having first acquired the skill of exquisite delineation and laying of pure color, day by day you must draw some lovely natural form or flower or animal without obscurity-as in missal painting; choosing for study, in natural scenes, only what is beautiful and strong in life.
1188_133604_000024_000000 But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
1188_133604_000018_000001 The brown ground beneath is left, for the most part; one touch of black is put for the hollow; two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve; and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible.
1188_133604_000048_000001 Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely.
1188_133604_000000_000000 three.
1188_133604_000062_000001 This is no longer to make us think of the death of happy souls, but of the labor of unhappy ones; at least, of the more or less limited, dullest, and-I must not say homely, but-unhomely life of the neglected agricultural poor.
1284_1181_000027_000000 "This powder must not be used before to morrow morning; but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled."
1284_1181_000031_000000 "I know; but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and gossip," declared dr Pipt.
1284_1181_000047_000000 "Yes; that's proper cat talk," declared the woman, and opened the door.
1284_1181_000012_000000 "No; I am sure I am right about that," returned the woman.
1284_1181_000004_000000 "She will have to work, when she comes to life," said Margolotte.
1284_1181_000014_000000 "Well, that may be true," agreed Margolotte; "but, on the contrary, a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work.
1284_1181_000031_000001 "Most people talk too much, so it is a relief to find one who talks too little."
1284_1181_000038_000000 "It truly is," asserted the Magician.
1284_1181_000021_000003 When the mixture was complete there was scarcely a handful, all told.
1284_1181_000001_000000 Chapter Three
1284_1181_000037_000000 "Magic must be a very interesting study," said Ojo.
1284_1181_000003_000002 Margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it-using the same gay material throughout.
1284_1181_000019_000000 "A little 'Cleverness'?
1284_1181_000015_000002 "Ingenuity," "Amiability,"
1284_1181_000013_000000 "He means," explained Ojo, "that unless your servant has good brains she won't know how to obey you properly, nor do the things you ask her to do."
1284_1181_000034_000000 "No; I am quite proud of my person," was the reply.
1284_1181_000018_000000 "Little," said he.
1284_1181_000020_000000 "Quick, Margolotte!
1284_1181_000005_000000 The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.
1284_1181_000003_000004 All the fingers and thumbs of the girl's hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and stitched at the edges, with gold plates at the ends to serve as finger nails.
1284_1181_000008_000002 If I get tired looking at her patched face I can whitewash it."
1284_1181_000015_000003 "Learning," "Truth,"
1284_1181_000040_000005 It will never break nor wear out."
1284_1181_000023_000002 No one saw him do this, for all were looking at the Powder of Life; but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing, and came back to the cupboard.
1284_1181_000033_000000 "Don't you find it very annoying to be so crooked?" he asked.
1284_1181_000036_000000 "I am not allowed to perform magic, except for my own amusement," he told his visitors, as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke.
1284_1181_000042_000001 But just then there came a scratching at the back door and a shrill voice cried:
1284_1181_000009_000000 "Has she any brains?" asked Ojo.
1284_1181_000014_000002 I want her to know just enough, but not too much."
1284_1181_000045_000000 "Ask like a good cat, then," she said.
1284_1181_000026_000001 But the Magician replied:
1284_1181_000039_000000 "What does the Liquid of Petrifaction do?" inquired the boy.
1284_1181_000020_000001 Come and help me."
1284_1181_000028_000001 Very carefully he placed the Powder of Life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.
1284_1181_000003_000001 The Patchwork Girl was taller than he, when she stood upright, and her body was plump and rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton.
1284_1180_000005_000001 Ojo was hungry, though; so he divided the piece of bread upon the table and ate his half for breakfast, washing it down with fresh, cool water from the brook.
1284_1180_000042_000001 "The more one knows, the luckier he is, for knowledge is the greatest gift in life."
1284_1180_000016_000000 "A lonelier place!
1284_1180_000050_000000 "Yes, for a Munchkin.
1284_1180_000050_000002 But in other parts of Oz the people favor different colors.
1284_1180_000030_000001 "I would like to do that."
1284_1180_000045_000002 What is that?" Ojo asked, for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a Glass Cat.
1284_1180_000045_000000 "Oh!
1284_1180_000039_000000 "What did old Mombi the Witch do with the Powder of Life your husband gave her?" asked the boy.
1284_1180_000043_000000 "But tell me, please, what you intend to do with this new lot of the Powder of Life, which dr Pipt is making.
1284_1180_000036_000000 "Yes; it is perfection," she declared.
1284_1180_000011_000000 "Ah," said Ojo; "you must be Dame Margolotte, the good wife of dr Pipt."
1284_1180_000020_000000 "I never knew I was called the Unlucky," said Ojo, soberly; "but it is really a good name for me."
1284_1180_000028_000000 The woman seemed thoughtful.
1284_1180_000006_000002 For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful Land of Oz in which they lived.
1284_1180_000027_000000 "We are traveling," replied Ojo, "and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves.
1284_1180_000035_000000 "Perhaps the Powder of Life couldn't either," said Ojo.
1284_1180_000016_000002 "Then it must be somewhere in the Blue Forest."
1284_1180_000023_000000 "I do not know how, but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you," she replied.
1284_1180_000015_000001 "We have come from a far lonelier place than this."
1284_1180_000004_000004 Instead of shoes, the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.
1284_1180_000049_000000 "Is blue the only respectable color, then?" inquired Ojo.
1284_1180_000024_000001 There was a savory stew, smoking hot, a dish of blue peas, a bowl of sweet milk of a delicate blue tint and a blue pudding with blue plums in it.
1284_1180_000040_000000 "She brought Jack Pumpkinhead to life, for one thing," was the reply. "I suppose you've heard of Jack Pumpkinhead.
1284_1180_000044_000001 "I want it to bring my Patchwork Girl to life."
1284_1180_000050_000001 All our country is blue, you know.
1284_1180_000047_000000 "What is a patchwork quilt?" asked Ojo.
1284_1180_000045_000001 A Patchwork Girl?
1284_1180_000007_000000 At the foot of the mountain that separated the Country of the Munchkins from the Country of the Gillikins, the path divided.
1284_1180_000046_000000 "I think I must show you my Patchwork Girl," said Margolotte, laughing at the boy's astonishment, "for she is rather difficult to explain.
1284_1180_000025_000000 "Do you wish to see dr Pipt on business or for pleasure?"
1284_1180_000017_000000 "It is, good Dame Margolotte."
1284_1180_000006_000000 Ojo was well pleased.
1284_1180_000018_000001 "And you must be Ojo the Unlucky," she added.
1284_1180_000030_000000 "Thank you," replied the boy, much pleased.
1284_1180_000043_000001 He said his wife wanted it for some especial purpose."
1284_1180_000016_000001 And in the Munchkin Country?" she exclaimed.
1284_1180_000001_000000 The Crooked Magician
1284_1180_000029_000001 The Magician is very busy, as I said, but if you will promise not to disturb him you may come into his workshop and watch him prepare a wonderful charm."
1284_1180_000053_000001 I will show you what a good job I did," and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
1284_1180_000037_000000 "A Glass Cat!" exclaimed Ojo, astonished.
1284_1180_000022_000000 "How can I lose that 'Un,' Dame Margolotte?"
1284_1180_000008_000001 Then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of dr Pipt.
1284_1180_000004_000000 Ojo dressed.
1284_1180_000007_000001 One way led to the left and the other to the right-straight up the mountain.
7729_102255_000023_000001 Buford, of Alabama; titus, of Florida; Wilkes, of Virginia; Hampton, of Kentucky; Treadwell, of South Carolina, and others, brought not only enthusiastic leadership, but substantial assistance. Both the factions which had come so near to actual battle in the "Wakarusa war," though nominally disbanded, in reality continued their military organizations,--the free State men through apprehension of danger, the Border Ruffians because of their purpose to crush out opposition.
7729_102255_000035_000002 The Free State Hotel, a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet, three stories high and handsomely furnished, previously occupied only for lodging rooms, on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public, and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion.
7729_102255_000004_000001 All dissent, all non compliance, all hesitation, all mere silence even, were in their stronghold towns, like Leavenworth, branded as "abolitionism," declared to be hostility to the public welfare, and punished with proscription, personal violence, expulsion, and frequently death.
7729_102255_000021_000000 The truce patched up by this Lawrence treaty was of comparatively short duration.
7729_102255_000036_000004 Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
7729_102255_000003_000000 With such a radical opposition of sentiment, both factions were on the alert to seize every available vantage ground.
7729_102255_000024_000003 This was, of course, the original controversy-slavery burning to enforce her usurpation, freedom determined to defend her birthright.
7729_102255_000024_000000 The vague and double meaning phrases of the Lawrence agreement furnished the earliest causes of a renewal of the quarrel.
7729_102255_000040_000003 In this incident, contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions, the Emigrant Aid Society of Massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication.
7729_102255_000016_000005 The Governor, on his part, becoming doubtful of the legality of employing Missouri militia to enforce Kansas laws, was also eager to secure the help of Federal troops. Sheriff Jones began to grow importunate.
7729_102255_000032_000002 The free State officers and leaders were, thanks to Judge Lecompte's doctrine of constructive treason, under indictment, arrest, or in flight; the settlers were busy with their spring crops; while the pro slavery guerrillas, freshly arrived and full of zeal, were eager for service and distinction.
7729_102255_000010_000006 To these an urgent appeal for help was made; and the leaders of the conspiracy in prompt obedience placarded the frontier with inflammatory handbills, and collected and equipped companies, and hurried them forward to the rendezvous without a moment's delay.
7729_102255_000020_000003 The Governor was denounced as a traitor, and Sheriff Jones declared that "he would have wiped out Lawrence." Atchison, on the contrary, sustained the bargain, explaining that to attack Lawrence under the circumstances would ruin the Democratic cause.
7729_102255_000002_000009 The free State men had only their convictions, their intelligence, their courage, and the moral support of the North; the conspiracy had its secret combination, the territorial officials, the Legislature, the bogus laws, the courts, the militia officers, the President, and the army.
7729_102255_000003_000001 The bogus laws having been enacted, and the free State men having, at the Big Springs Convention, resolved on the failure of peaceable remedies to resist them to a "bloody issue," the conspiracy was not slow to cover itself and its projects with the sacred mantle of authority.
7729_102255_000027_000004 No posse was summoned, no further effort made, and Reeder, fearing personal violence, soon fled in disguise.
7729_102255_000018_000006 Neither party was willing to yield honestly nor ready to fight manfully.
7729_102255_000024_000002 "We may have said that we would assist any proper officer in the service of any legal process," they replied, standing upon their interpretation.
7729_102255_000018_000003 He directed his militia generals to repress disorder and check any attack on the town. Interviews were held with the free State commanders, and the situation was fully discussed.
7729_102255_000010_000015 While the Governor's proclamation spoke of serving writs, the notices of the conspirators sounded the note of the real contest.
7729_102255_000003_000004 His reception speech at Westport, in which he maintained the legality of the Legislature, and his determination to enforce their laws, delighted his pro slavery auditors.
7729_102255_000004_000000 Faithful to their legislative declaration they knew but one issue, slavery.
7729_102255_000016_000006 In the Missouri camp while the leaders became alarmed the men grew insubordinate.
7729_102255_000010_000014 They were not only well armed and supplied, but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement.
7729_102255_000007_000002 Out of this incident, the officious sheriff managed most ingeniously to create an embroilment with the town of Lawrence, Buckley, who was alleged to have been accessory to the crime, obtained a peace warrant against Branson, a neighbor of the victim.
7729_102255_000020_000002 There were similar murmurs in the pro slavery camps.
7729_102255_000016_000007 "I have reason to believe," wrote one of their prominent men, "that before to morrow morning the black flag will be hoisted, when nine out of ten will rally round it, and march without orders upon Lawrence.
7729_102255_000041_000000 [Relocated Footnote: Governor Robinson being on his way East, the steamboat on which he was traveling stopped at Lexington, Missouri.
7729_102255_000034_000000 They next made application to the marshal, who tauntingly replied that he could not rely on their pledges, and must take the liberty to execute his process in his own time and manner.
7729_102255_000002_000001 The bogus Legislature numbered thirty six members.
7729_102255_000035_000001 He continued his pretended search and, to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
7729_102255_000027_000001 To embarrass this damaging exposure, Judge Lecompte issued a writ against the ex Governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
7729_102255_000034_000005 Ten days were consumed in these negotiations; but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729_102255_000003_000003 Coming by way of the Missouri River towns, he fell first among Border Ruffian companionship and influences; and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his Washington instructions, his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free State cause.
7729_102255_000012_000007 With the advantage of its defensive position, Lawrence was as strong as the sheriff's mob.
7729_102255_000016_000008 The forces of the Lecompton camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner."
7729_102255_000018_000007 The free State men shrank from forcible resistance to even bogus laws.
7729_102255_000024_000005 Little by little, however, the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws.
7729_102255_000010_000002 A Border Ruffian foray against the town was hastily organized.
7729_102255_000005_000000 Among other instrumentalities for executing the bogus laws, the bogus Legislature had appointed one Samuel j Jones sheriff of Douglas county kansas Territory, although that individual was at the time of his appointment, and long afterwards, United States postmaster of the town of Westport, Missouri.
7729_102255_000020_000006 He ordered the forces to disband; prisoners were liberated, and with the opportune aid of a furious rain storm the Border Ruffian army gradually melted away.
7729_102255_000024_000006 President Pierce, in his special message of january twenty fourth, declared what had been done by the Topeka movement to be "of a revolutionary character" which would "become treasonable insurrection if it reach the length of organized resistance."
7729_102255_000020_000004 "But," he added with a significant oath, "boys, we will fight some time!" Thirteen of the captains in the Wakarusa camp were called together, and the situation was duly explained.
7729_102255_000001_000000 CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS
7729_102255_000018_000010 They consented to a compromise "to cover a retreat."
7729_102255_000016_000004 One of his militia generals suggested that the Governor should require the "outlaws at Lawrence and elsewhere" to surrender the Sharps rifles; another wrote asking him to call out the Government troops at Fort Leavenworth.
7729_102255_000010_000007 The United States Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri, was broken into and stripped of its contents to supply cannon, small arms, and ammunition.
7729_102255_000012_000012 They might be deaf to the "equalities" proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence or blind to the moral sin of slavery, but they comprehended a rifle which could be fired ten times a minute and kill a man at a thousand yards.
7729_102255_000032_000001 A propitious moment for carrying it out seemed now to have arrived.
7729_102255_000025_000004 One additional incident served to precipitate the crisis.
7729_102255_000018_000002 He hastened to Lawrence, which now invoked his protection.
7729_102255_000004_000002 Of the lynchings, the mobs, and the murders, it would be impossible, except in a very extended work, to note the frequent and atrocious details.
7729_102255_000028_000003 From these, again, sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings, camps and scouting parties, finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands, half partisan, half predatory.
7729_102255_000012_000011 The Missouri backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun.
7729_102255_000027_000005 But the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free State men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
7729_102255_000036_000005 The inmates being removed, at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls.
7729_102255_000035_000003 The marshal and his posse, including Sheriff Jones, went among other invited guests and enjoyed the proffered hospitality.
7729_102255_000028_000007 Organized and sustained in the beginning by voluntary contributions from that and distant States, they ended by levying forced contributions, by "pressing" horses, food, or arms from any neighborhood they chanced to visit.
7729_102255_000012_000002 They, on the other hand, professing no purpose but that of defense and self protection, were obliged to permit free and constant ingress to their beleaguered town.
7729_102255_000012_000003 Sheriff Jones made several visits unmolested on their part, and without any display of writs or demand for the surrender of alleged offenders on his own.
7729_102255_000003_000002 Opportunely for them, about this time Governor Shannon, appointed to succeed Reeder, arrived in the Territory.
7729_102255_000011_000003 The Free State Hotel served as barracks.
7729_102255_000010_000016 "Now is the time to show game, and if we are defeated this time, the Territory is lost to the South," said the leaders.
7729_102255_000025_000003 The people of Lawrence denounced the deed; but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge.
7729_102255_000016_000002 The firm defensive attitude of the people of Lawrence had produced its effect.
7729_102255_000027_000000 Ex Governor Reeder was in attendance on this committee, supplying data, pointing out from personal knowledge sources of information, cross examining witnesses to elicit the hidden truth.
7729_102255_000013_000001 The irregular Border Ruffian squads were hastily incorporated into the skeleton "Kansas militia." The "posse" became some two thousand strong, and the defenders of Lawrence perhaps one thousand.
7729_102255_000003_000006 All the territorial dignitaries were present; Governor Shannon presided; john Calhoun, the Surveyor General, made the principal speech, a denunciation of the "abolitionists" supporting the Topeka movement; Chief Justice Lecompte dignified the occasion with approving remarks.
7729_102255_000012_000001 The people of Lawrence, without any great difficulty, obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps.
7729_102255_000010_000000 Burning with the thirst of personal revenge, Sheriff Jones now accused the town of Lawrence of the violation of law involved in this rescue, though the people of Lawrence immediately and earnestly disavowed the act.
7729_102255_000028_000005 The free State men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides.
7729_102255_000011_000004 Governor Robinson and Colonel Lane were appointed to command.
7729_102255_000002_000005 That summer's emigration, however, being mainly from the free States, greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
7729_102255_000028_000004 Their distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unfailing difference.
7729_102255_000010_000017 There was no doubt of the earnestness of their purpose.
7729_102255_000021_000003 During and after the contest over the speakership at Washington, each State Legislature became a forum of Kansas debate.
7729_102255_000035_000000 During the forenoon the deputy marshal rode leisurely into the town attended by less than a dozen men, being neither molested nor opposed. He summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse, who followed, obeyed, and assisted him.
7729_102255_000028_000008 Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
7729_102255_000002_000010 This was a formidable array of advantages; slavery was playing with loaded dice.
7729_102255_000007_000004 Alarm being given, Branson's free State neighbors, already exasperated at the murder, rose under the sudden instinct of self protection and rescued Branson from the sheriff and his posse that same night, though without other violence than harsh words.
7729_102255_000032_000006 The Governor refused to interfere to protect the threatened town, though an urgent appeal to do so was made to him by its citizens, who after stormy and divided councils resolved on a policy of non resistance.
7729_102255_000041_000002 In a few days an officer came with a requisition from Governor Shannon, and took the prisoner by land to Westport, and afterwards from there to Kansas City and Leavenworth.
7729_102255_000012_000008 On one point especially the Border Ruffians had a wholesome dread.
7729_102255_000002_000003 This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.
7729_102255_000016_000003 The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729_102255_000018_000008 The Missouri cabal, on the other hand, having three of their best men constantly at the Governor's side, were compelled to recognize their lack of justification.
7729_102255_000021_000004 The general public interest in the controversy was shown by discussions carried on by press, pulpit, and in the daily conversation and comment of the people of the Union in every town, hamlet, and neighborhood.
7729_102255_000007_000003 With this peace warrant in his pocket, but without showing or reading it to his prisoner, Sheriff Jones and a posse of twenty five Border Ruffians proceeded to Branson's house at midnight and arrested him.
7729_102255_000007_000001 The murderer, a pro slavery man, first fled, to Missouri, but returned to Shawnee Mission and sought the official protection of Sheriff Jones; no warrant, no examination, no commitment followed, and the criminal remained at large.
7729_102255_000012_000006 They could see that a conflict meant serious results.
7729_102255_000035_000006 The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
7729_102255_000011_000001 Two abortive imitations of the Missouri Blue Lodges, set on foot during the summer by the free State men, provoked by the election invasion in March, furnished them a starting point for military organization.
7729_102255_000012_000009 Yankee ingenuity had invented a new kind of breech loading gun called "Sharps rifle." It was, in fact, the best weapon of its day.
7729_102255_000016_000000 Meanwhile a sober second thought had come to Governor Shannon.
7729_102255_000028_000009 They were squads of Kansas militia, companies of "peaceful emigrants," or gangs of irresponsible outlaws, to suit the chance, the whim, or the need of the moment.
7729_102255_000002_000008 For general service, therefore, requiring no special effort, the numerical strength of the factions was about equal; while on extraordinary occasions the two thousand Border Ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the State line could at any time easily turn the scale.
7729_102255_000036_000003 Half an hour later, turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance, he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the Free State Hotel.
4446_2273_000025_000002 He's a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever.
4446_2273_000038_000003 I hope so."
4446_2273_000040_000003 But he's given me some good Irish songs.
4446_2273_000002_000000 The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare, the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who had come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to Miss Burgoyne.
4446_2273_000008_000000 Hilda curtsied.
4446_2273_000023_000001 "Oh, yes, I go over to Paris often.
4446_2273_000008_000004 I don't need Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don't like English cookery."
4446_2273_000034_000000 "I expect it was the last franc I had.
4446_2273_000014_000002 You've got awfully nice friends," he added humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk.
4446_2273_000022_000003 Have you been in Paris much these late years?"
4446_2273_000002_000005 Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their 'bus.
4446_2273_000050_000003 Good night."
4446_2273_000000_000000 CHAPTER four
4446_2273_000043_000002 Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!"
4446_2273_000006_000001 Hilda was writing in her living room, under the light of a tall desk lamp.
4446_2273_000052_000003 Good night."
4446_2273_000052_000002 This isn't fair, you know.
4446_2273_000037_000003 Mac is writing one; really for me this time.
4446_2273_000036_000000 Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her.
4446_2273_000019_000001 Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasn't been stowed away.
4446_2273_000001_000008 He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young girl's party.
4446_2273_000046_000002 Can't I get a scarf or something?"
4446_2273_000003_000002 For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.
4446_2273_000001_000002 Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea.
4446_2273_000023_000000 Hilda lowered one of the candle shades carefully.
4446_2273_000037_000002 Have I told you about my new play?
4446_2273_000050_000002 You must go now, Bartley.
4446_2273_000013_000001 Though Marie is clean-really clean, as the French are.
4446_2273_000003_000000 Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon.
4446_2273_000014_000001 "I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about you.
4446_2273_000043_000001 Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
4446_2273_000006_000000 When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.
4446_2273_000025_000000 "Well, he is still clever and lazy.
4446_2273_000050_000001 "Here, take it.
4446_2273_000003_000001 He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind.
4446_2273_000034_000002 She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black shawl.
4446_2273_000016_000000 Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.
4446_2273_000035_000003 They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.
4446_2273_000009_000000 Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.
4446_2273_000015_000002 I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons.
4446_2273_000041_000001 When she finished, Alexander shook himself out of a reverie.
4446_2273_000020_000002 He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.
4446_2273_000037_000004 You see, I'm coming on."
4446_2273_000048_000002 See how white the stars are."
4446_2273_000011_000000 "Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas.
4446_2273_000001_000005 He seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively.
4446_2273_000034_000004 I remember it touched me so.
4446_2273_000022_000002 "You have traveled, you say.
4446_2273_000015_000003 He's that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get.
4446_2273_000024_000001 I'm so sorry to hear it.
4446_2273_000018_000001 Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.
4446_2273_000020_000001 There was watercress soup, and sole, and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had always been very fond.
4446_2273_000052_000000 "Yes.
4446_2273_000045_000001 Don't you feel it?"
4446_2273_000052_000001 Take it and go.
4446_2273_000010_000000 "I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
4446_2273_000037_000001 "Well, we are neither of us twenty now, you know.
4446_2273_000035_000000 They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God give you a happy love!"
4446_2273_000046_000000 Alexander went over and opened the window for her.
4446_2273_000043_000000 "Nonsense.
4446_2273_000037_000000 Hilda laughed and went over to the piano.
4446_2273_000002_000003 On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation.
4446_2273_000042_000001 You used to sing it so well."
4446_2273_000002_000009 American tours have spoiled them, I'm afraid.
4446_2273_000024_000000 "Don't I, though!
4446_2273_000022_000001 But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about.
4446_2273_000007_000000 "I'm so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know," he said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair.
4446_2273_000035_000002 Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both.
4446_2273_000002_000006 They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.
4446_2273_000008_000002 I've no need for fine clothes in Mac's play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for myself.
4446_2273_000011_000003 He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg."
4446_2273_000018_000000 It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf full of china.
4446_2273_000035_000001 It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature's sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy.
4446_2273_000022_000000 "Thank you.
4446_2273_000003_000003 On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square.
4446_2273_000008_000003 It's owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner.
4446_2273_000012_000001 "It's the air of the whole place here that I like.
4446_2273_000010_000002 They're quite unusual, aren't they?"
4446_2273_000012_000000 Alexander walked over to the bookcases.
4446_2273_000006_000002 Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady Walford's.
4446_2273_000013_000003 Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market yesterday morning."
4446_2273_000001_000001 He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there.
4446_2273_000045_000000 Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. "It's really too warm in this room to sing.
4446_2273_000002_000002 Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the fourth dimension.
4446_2273_000002_000010 They have all grown very smart.
4446_2273_000025_000003 But Angel-do you remember Angel?"
4446_2273_000049_000000 For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.
4446_2273_000034_000003 What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.
4446_2273_000033_000003 I was frightened at your prodigality."
4446_2273_000034_000005 I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could.
4446_2273_000038_000002 Shall you wear yellow gowns?
4446_2273_000010_000001 Where did you get those etchings?
4446_2273_000040_000004 Listen."
4446_2273_000021_000002 There is nothing else that looks so jolly."
4446_2273_000032_000000 Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly.
4446_2273_000014_000000 "I'm glad," said Alexander simply.
4446_2273_000028_000000 Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a low, happy laugh.
4446_2273_000031_000001 We walked on down by the river, didn't we?"
4446_2273_000019_000002 We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre-queer theatres, for that matter."
4446_2273_000041_000000 She sat down at the piano and sang.
4446_2273_000036_000003 It was very jolly," he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
4446_2273_000048_000000 Alexander caught the agitation in her voice.
4446_2273_000002_000011 Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy."
4446_2273_000001_000003 Alexander arrived early, and some twenty odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon.
4446_2273_000015_000004 And I've traveled a bit, too."
4446_2273_000021_000001 I don't drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it's poured.
4446_2273_000014_000004 They don't talk of any one else as they do of you."
4446_2273_000047_000004 "Isn't London a tomb on Sunday night?"
4446_2273_000015_000001 It's not worth much, but I love it.
4446_2273_000002_000008 There aren't many such left.
4446_2273_000040_000000 "No, it isn't a dress up part.
4446_2273_000017_000000 "My dining room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you have ever seen."
4446_2273_000033_000002 I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc.
4446_2273_000028_000001 "How jolly it was being young, Hilda!
4446_2273_000047_000000 "Ask a theatre lady if she's afraid of drafts!" Hilda laughed.
4446_2273_000027_000004 She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and was so delighted to see me again.
4446_2273_000003_000004 He sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled across the front.
4446_2273_000027_000002 Too bad!
4446_2273_000001_000000 On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne's invitation and called at her apartment.
4446_2273_000024_000002 How did her son turn out?
4446_2273_000038_000001 What kind of a part is it?
4446_2273_000027_000005 I gave her all my old clothes, even my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress.
4446_2273_000033_000001 "It was on the Quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly.
4446_2273_000034_000001 What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic.
4446_2273_000007_000002 Every one at Lady Walford's was looking at it."
4446_2273_000027_000006 Her hair is still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby's, and she has the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her bains de mer."
4446_2273_000026_000001 Did she ever get back to Brittany and her bains de mer?"
4446_2273_000019_000000 "It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.
4446_2273_000023_000002 There are few changes in the old Quarter.
4446_2273_000047_000001 "But perhaps, as I'm so warm-give me your handkerchief.
4446_2273_000028_000002 Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris?
4446_2273_000035_000004 When they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had kissed her for the first time.
4446_2273_000044_000001 "All the same, sing it, Hilda."
4446_2273_000036_000002 I had quite forgotten-I was back there.
4446_2273_000036_000001 "Dear me, why did you do that?
4446_2273_000050_000000 She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning round.
4446_2273_000054_000001 "Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?" she whispered.
4446_2273_000051_000000 Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: "You are giving me a chance?"
4446_2273_000029_000000 "Indeed I do.
4446_2273_000015_000000 Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway.
4446_2273_000005_000000 h b
4446_2273_000013_000000 "Rooms always look better by lamplight-in London, at least.
4446_2273_000021_000000 "I have some champagne for you, too.
4446_2273_000035_000005 He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so-
4446_2273_000001_000004 Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his tea cup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deep set, faded eyes.
4446_2273_000048_000001 He stood a little behind her, and tried to steady himself as he said: "It's soft and misty.
4446_2273_000046_000001 "Aren't you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck?
4446_2273_000028_000004 Do you remember how sweet they smelled?"
4446_2271_000005_000005 Do you know, Alexander,"--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--"do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.
4446_2271_000023_000004 Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all.
4446_2271_000022_000013 "All the same," he lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda.
4446_2271_000011_000000 The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face.
4446_2271_000015_000007 Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.
4446_2271_000010_000000 "MacConnell, let me introduce mr Bartley Alexander.
4446_2271_000013_000000 MacConnell grunted.
4446_2271_000022_000014 You've made things come your way, and I never thought you'd do it.
4446_2271_000003_000003 But Hilda Burgoyne's the hit of the piece. Hugh's written a delightful part for her, and she's quite inexpressible. It's been on only two weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell's box for tonight or there'd be no chance of our getting places.
4446_2271_000022_000006 After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man.
4446_2271_000022_000012 He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her.
4446_2271_000014_000000 He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.
4446_2271_000003_000004 There's everything in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
4446_2271_000010_000001 I say!
4446_2271_000007_000004 She saves her hand, too.
4446_2271_000015_000003 She doesn't take up with anybody, you know.
4446_2271_000015_000001 "He's hit terribly hard.
4446_2271_000009_000001 They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
4446_2271_000008_000000 The second act opened before Philly Doyle's underground still, with Peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen across the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather.
4446_2271_000003_000001 "It's tremendously well put on, too.
4446_2271_000024_000000 Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
4446_2271_000015_000004 Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
4446_2271_000023_000000 "Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
4446_2271_000022_000010 I should torture myself-I couldn't help it." After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
4446_2271_000015_000006 I dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
4446_2271_000023_000001 But I never thought she'd do anything.
4446_2271_000006_000004 She doubtless hasn't thought of me for years." He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy.
4446_2271_000022_000005 When he wrote her that everything was changed for him, he was telling the truth.
4446_2271_000006_000005 The audience had come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing.
4446_2271_000015_000009 He's another who's awfully keen about her.
4446_2271_000007_000003 That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips-who ever heard it out of Galway?
4446_2271_000006_000000 Just then they drove up to the Duke of York's, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.
4446_2271_000015_000002 He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.
4446_2271_000018_000000 "I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she?"
4446_2271_000015_000008 Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
4446_2271_000005_000000 Mainhall laughed.
4446_2271_000022_000003 Hilda had never replied to his letter.
4446_2271_000023_000003 She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
4446_2271_000005_000006 In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one."
4446_2271_000020_000000 He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
4446_2271_000023_000011 I shouldn't wonder- But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if one met her again."
4446_2271_000019_000002 The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy, poor child.
4446_2271_000008_000001 Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall's sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half skeptical interest.
4446_2271_000015_000005 One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe.
4446_2271_000015_000011 Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
4446_2271_000004_000001 "Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
4446_2271_000007_000006 She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."
4446_2271_000007_000005 She's at her best in the second act.
4446_2271_000010_000002 It's going famously to night, Mac.
4446_2271_000008_000003 When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.
4446_2271_000023_000009 It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly.
4446_2271_000010_000003 And what an audience!
4446_2271_000016_000000 Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met mr Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.
4446_2271_000007_000002 It's delightful to hear it in a London theatre.
4446_2271_000011_000001 "And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked.
4446_2271_000019_000003 Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.
4446_2271_000023_000006 She was a daft, generous little thing.
4446_2271_000021_000002 For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.
4446_2271_000001_000001 The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.
4446_2271_000003_000005 She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
4446_2271_000006_000002 As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
4446_2271_000012_000002 Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn't possibly be better, you know."
4446_2271_000020_000001 Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda."
4446_2271_000005_000002 It's only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come up.
4446_2271_000023_000008 After all, we were awfully young.
4446_2271_000019_000004 A little attack of nerves, possibly."
4446_2271_000001_000003 In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair.
4446_2271_000010_000004 You'll never do anything like this again, mark me.
4446_2271_000023_000002 She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
4446_2271_000003_000000 "It's really quite the best thing MacConnell's done," he explained as they got into a hansom.
4446_2271_000022_000000 When Alexander returned to his hotel-he shook Mainhall at the door of the theatre-he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late before he went to bed.
4446_2271_000006_000001 When they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland.
4446_2271_000023_000005 Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good.
4446_2271_000017_000000 Mainhall cut in impatiently.
4446_2271_000008_000002 As Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful brown eyes.
4446_2271_000010_000005 A man writes to the top of his bent only once."
4446_2271_000001_000006 He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
4446_2275_000028_000000 Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
4446_2275_000002_000003 The room was empty when he entered.
4446_2275_000019_000003 It tortures me every minute."
4446_2275_000035_000000 She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
4446_2275_000023_000000 "Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
4446_2275_000019_000000 "Always.
4446_2275_000031_000002 He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
4446_2275_000043_000002 I don't trust myself any more.
4446_2275_000024_000000 He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
4446_2275_000039_000000 "I can't," he said heavily.
4446_2275_000010_000000 "What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
4446_2275_000002_000006 He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in.
4446_2275_000019_000001 But it's worse now.
4446_2275_000042_000005 Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
4446_2275_000033_000002 At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
4446_2275_000046_000000 "Just something Bartley.
4446_2275_000045_000001 Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.
4446_2275_000046_000002 I must see you.
4446_2275_000043_000001 "Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
4446_2275_000029_000002 We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy."
4446_2275_000002_000005 Alexander did not sit down.
4446_2275_000038_000002 But I didn't know.
4446_2275_000012_000000 "Everything!"
4446_2275_000046_000001 I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
4446_2275_000022_000001 She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
4446_2275_000033_000001 "Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
4446_2275_000048_000002 Forget everything except that I am here."
4446_2275_000037_000000 Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
4446_2275_000042_000009 Do you understand?
4446_2275_000027_000000 "After the very first.
4446_2275_000018_000000 "It . . . it hasn't always made you miserable, has it?" Her eyelids fell and her lips quivered.
4446_2275_000046_000003 I must know about you.
4446_2275_000021_000004 The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
4446_2275_000002_000002 She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room.
4446_2275_000042_000001 "It's too late to ask that.
4446_2275_000038_000005 "You want me to say it?" she whispered.
4446_2275_000029_000001 "I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
4446_2275_000002_000013 Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
4446_2275_000044_000006 I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
4446_2275_000025_000000 He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
4446_2275_000045_000000 Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again.
4446_2275_000003_000000 She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
4446_2275_000002_000008 "Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
4446_2275_000036_000001 I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too.
4446_2275_000013_000002 She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.
4446_2275_000016_000000 He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
4446_2275_000042_000000 "No!" she gasped.
4446_2275_000043_000003 I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
4446_2275_000042_000007 The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
4446_2275_000044_000004 And I've got nobody but you.
4446_2275_000048_000000 "Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
4446_2275_000046_000008 And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
4446_2275_000021_000003 I get nothing but misery out of either.
4446_2275_000036_000000 "You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.
4446_2275_000041_000000 Hilda sprang up like a flame.
4446_2275_000047_000001 Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
4446_2275_000002_000000 Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
4446_2275_000031_000001 Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
4446_2275_000044_000003 You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
4446_2275_000042_000006 But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
4446_2275_000032_000001 You know.
4446_2275_000025_000001 He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
4446_2275_000046_000007 Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
4446_2275_000005_000000 "I got in about ten minutes ago.
4446_2275_000043_000005 It's different now.
4446_2275_000042_000004 It's abominable of you to ask me.
4446_2275_000033_000000 "Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
4446_2275_000046_000005 "You see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different.
4446_2275_000016_000001 He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
4446_2275_000002_000009 I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
4446_2275_000026_000000 She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
4446_2275_000002_000004 A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
4446_2275_000029_000000 Alexander groaned.
4446_2275_000002_000007 She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder.
4446_2275_000038_000007 I can do that."
4446_2275_000027_000001 The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
4446_2275_000042_000010 Bartley, you're cowardly!"
4446_2275_000048_000001 "We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
4446_2275_000041_000001 She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
4446_2275_000008_000000 Bartley bent lower over the fire.
4446_2275_000036_000002 I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
4446_2275_000040_000003 I can't see you at all, anywhere.
4446_2275_000006_000001 Hilda watched him with perplexity.
4446_2275_000043_000006 I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
4446_2275_000006_000000 Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
4446_2275_000021_000002 "Each life spoils the other.
4446_2275_000036_000003 I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful-to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted."
4446_2275_000019_000002 It's unbearable.
4446_2275_000044_000000 Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
4446_2275_000043_000004 It's getting the better of me.
4446_2275_000042_000008 If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
4446_2275_000046_000006 If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
4446_2275_000038_000000 "I understand, Bartley.
4446_2275_000002_000010 I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
4446_2275_000008_000002 You and i"
4446_2275_000038_000003 You've only to tell me now.
4446_2275_000038_000004 What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
4446_2275_000005_000001 I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
4446_2275_000004_000001 You haven't spoken a word."
4446_2275_000011_000000 He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.
4446_2275_000007_000001 What is it?"
4446_2275_000040_000002 "It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
4446_2275_000011_000001 At last Alexander brought out one word:--
4446_2275_000014_000001 "I can't stand seeing you miserable."
4446_2275_000040_000004 What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
4446_2275_000047_000000 She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
4446_2275_000030_000000 "Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
4446_2275_000020_000000 "But why NOW?" she asked piteously, wringing her hands.
4446_2275_000009_000001 She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
4446_2275_000013_000000 Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
4446_2275_000031_000000 She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
4446_2275_000009_000000 Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
4446_2275_000046_000004 The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
4446_2275_000021_000000 He ignored her question.
4446_2275_000042_000003 I won't promise.
4446_2275_000007_000000 "There's something troubling you, Bartley.
4446_2275_000043_000000 Alexander rose and shook himself angrily.
4446_2275_000002_000012 But why do you let me chatter on like this?
4446_2275_000001_000000 The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
4446_2275_000038_000006 "You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
4446_2275_000040_000001 Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
4446_2275_000013_000001 She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
4446_2275_000014_000000 "I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously.
4446_2275_000044_000002 Why didn't you let me be angry with you?
4446_2275_000024_000002 I have thought about it until I am worn out."
4446_2275_000040_000000 Hilda shivered and sat still.
4446_2275_000021_000005 There is this deception between me and everything."
4446_2275_000002_000011 I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
4446_2275_000001_000001 The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4446_2275_000044_000005 I will do anything you say-but that!
260_123288_000041_000002 Alas! the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised every iron article on board.
260_123288_000016_000001 The piled up vapours condense into water; and the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind.
260_123288_000025_000000 Sunday, twenty three.--Where are we?
260_123288_000038_000000 Scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft.
260_123288_000005_000000 I feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes.
260_123288_000013_000003 The rudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea.
260_123288_000027_000002 Suppose that solid roof should crumble down upon our heads!
260_123288_000042_000000 Ah! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst, and we are deluged with tongues of fire!
260_123288_000039_000000 We lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror.
260_123288_000044_000001 Where?
260_123288_000011_000000 The Professor made no answer.
260_123288_000038_000001 Mast and sail flew up in an instant together, and I saw them carried up to prodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of those strong birds of the infant world.
260_123288_000032_000001 But Hans is as usual. The raft bears on still to the south-east.
260_123288_000009_000000 I am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet I cannot help muttering:
260_123288_000037_000000 He nods his consent.
260_123288_000012_000000 "There's a heavy storm coming on," I cried, pointing towards the horizon.
260_123288_000013_000001 The lately roaring winds are hushed into a dead calm; nature seems to breathe no more, and to be sinking into the stillness of death.
260_123288_000039_000001 The fireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a ten inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind.
260_123288_000015_000001 "Never!
260_123288_000026_000000 The night was fearful; no abatement of the storm.
260_123288_000016_000005 My uncle falls full length; I creep close to him.
260_123288_000046_000000 A fresh noise is heard!
260_123288_000016_000006 He has laid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.
260_123288_000045_000002 Are we still under the sea?
260_123288_000024_000002 But their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the excitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even better than my memory could do.)
260_123288_000030_000001 I refer to the thermometer; it indicates . . . (the figure is obliterated).
260_123288_000023_000005 My eyes fail under the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
260_123288_000041_000001 Is it riveted to the planks?
260_123288_000006_000000 In the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up in picturesque disorder.
260_123288_000007_000000 The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity. My whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine.
260_123288_000016_000004 The helm makes a bound.
260_123288_000003_000001 The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from Axel Island.
260_123288_000028_000000 From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light; electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules; the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture; for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
260_123288_000025_000001 Driven forward with a swiftness that cannot be measured.
260_123288_000001_000000 CHAPTER thirty five.
260_123288_000008_000000 At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated.
260_123288_000013_000000 A deep silence falls on all around.
260_123288_000044_000000 But where are we going to?
260_123288_000003_000002 The roarings become lost in the distance.
260_123288_000033_000002 Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft.
260_123288_000006_000004 From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist, with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense floor of grey, and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass.
260_123288_000007_000001 It seems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.
260_123288_000015_000000 "No, no! Never!" shouted my impetuous uncle.
260_123288_000020_000000 "The sail! the sail!" I cry, motioning to lower it.
260_123288_000006_000002 Such is their ponderous weight that they cannot rise from the horizon; but, obeying an impulse from higher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields.
260_123288_000035_000002 They seem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.
260_123288_000027_000003 Other flashes with incessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll themselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells, but the music of which scarcely adds to the din of the battle strife that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight; the limit of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can distinguish one sound from another.
260_123288_000016_000003 The darkness deepens; scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes.
260_123288_000030_000000 The heat increases.
260_123288_000011_000002 He can only spare time to shrug his shoulders viciously.
260_123288_000024_000001 I have only been able to find a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously.
260_123288_000011_000001 His temper is awful, to judge from the working of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean unrolling before him to an indefinite extent.
260_123288_000027_000000 The lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to cease for a moment.
260_123288_000023_000004 The heaving waves resemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior flames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire.
260_123288_000002_000000 AN ELECTRIC STORM
260_123288_000013_000002 On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent st Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.
260_123288_000008_000001 The wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms.
260_123288_000033_000001 We are obliged to secure as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo.
260_123288_000004_000002 The clouds are sinking lower, and assume an olive hue.
260_123288_000045_000004 We have been carried under England, under the channel, under France, perhaps under the whole of Europe.
260_123288_000039_000003 And now my turn comes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the melting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the deck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.
260_123288_000033_000000 At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.
260_123288_000019_000001 The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst.
260_123288_000032_000002 We have made two hundred leagues since we left Axel Island.
260_123288_000004_000001 The atmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260_123288_000034_000001 Our mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard.
260_123288_000016_000002 It rushes on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern.
260_123288_000017_000000 Hans stirs not.
260_123288_000040_000001 We suffer stifling pains.
260_123288_000031_000001 Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?
260_123288_000043_000001 I could just see my uncle at full length on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire under the action of the electricity which has saturated him.
260_123288_000023_000006 I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm.
260_123288_000032_000000 We are prostrated and worn out with fatigue.
260_123288_000035_000000 My uncle has drawn nearer to me.
260_123288_000034_000002 We cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to the ear.
260_123288_000029_000001 My uncle lies full length across the raft.
260_123288_000017_000001 His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid flat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure; for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little luminous radiations.
260_123288_000043_000000 Then all the light disappears.
260_123288_000023_000001 But before it has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical power that descends from the higher regions.
260_123288_000036_000000 At last I write down the words: "Let us lower the sail."
260_123288_000012_000001 "Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea."
260_123288_000040_000000 A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat, it fills the lungs.
260_123288_000041_000003 The instruments, the tools, our guns, are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each other; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let into the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot.
260_123288_000015_000002 Let the wind catch us if it will!
260_123288_000045_000003 Yes, we are borne at incalculable speed.
260_123286_000038_000000 Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.
260_123286_000002_000000 A BATTLE OF MONSTERS
260_123286_000037_000003 During his watch I slept.
260_123286_000060_000004 Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.
260_123286_000011_000000 "Yet we are going very fast."
260_123286_000021_000002 Weather unchanged.
260_123286_000058_000000 The plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail, has four flappers or paddles to act like oars.
260_123286_000029_000002 I could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar.
260_123286_000057_000002 I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal, and as large as a man's head.
260_123286_000017_000000 "That is just the question.
260_123286_000005_000000 My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper.
260_123286_000045_000002 They were of supernatural dimensions; the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at one snap of its huge jaws.
260_123286_000019_000002 Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."
260_123286_000049_000005 He shakes his head negatively.
260_123286_000032_000001 No human eye has ever beheld them living.
260_123286_000008_000001 No, not at all."
260_123286_000034_000002 I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side.
260_123286_000034_000003 What a very bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here!
260_123286_000036_000001 The danger is approaching.
260_123286_000038_000001 The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
260_123286_000031_000001 The world then belonged to reptiles.
260_123286_000009_000000 "Impatient, then?"
260_123286_000028_000000 "Teeth!" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.
260_123286_000029_000000 Yes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal! The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength.
260_123286_000048_000003 I prepare to fire.
260_123286_000044_000001 "I can see its great fins.
260_123286_000047_000000 Flight was out of the question now.
260_123286_000058_000001 Its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a swan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.
260_123286_000061_000003 Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes like a worm that you tread on.
260_123286_000060_000005 Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water.
260_123286_000031_000003 They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
260_123286_000055_000000 "And the other?"
260_123286_000027_000001 I had rather not disturb him while he is quiet.
260_123286_000048_000002 The remainder of the sea monsters have disappeared.
260_123286_000013_000000 I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues.
260_123286_000003_000002 The horizon seems extremely distant.
260_123286_000057_000001 Two monsters only were creating all this commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
260_123286_000060_000002 The combatants alternately approach and recede from our raft.
260_123286_000016_000000 "But," I remarked, "since we have followed the road that Saknussemm has shown us-"
260_123286_000021_000003 The wind freshens.
260_123286_000033_000000 I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
260_123286_000033_000002 No; surely it cannot be!
260_123286_000012_000000 "What does that signify?
260_123286_000043_000001 Look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth!
260_123286_000027_000002 I return to the Icelander.
260_123286_000061_000000 All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the plesiosaurus.
260_123286_000010_000000 "One might be, with less reason than now."
260_123286_000022_000001 It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic-and why not?
260_123286_000035_000001 My uncle notices it, and looks on approvingly.
260_123286_000017_000001 Have we followed that road?
260_123286_000039_000001 "Have we struck land?"
260_123286_000043_000002 It is diving down!"
260_123286_000018_000000 "At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far.
260_123286_000025_000000 I looked at the hunter.
260_123286_000024_000000 But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies.
260_123286_000033_000003 Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
260_123286_000047_000003 I took up my rifle.
260_123286_000005_000001 He examines the horizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of an injured man.
260_123286_000001_000000 CHAPTER thirty three.
260_123286_000032_000002 They burdened this earth a thousand ages before man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the argillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and anatomically ascertained.
260_123286_000021_000004 On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light.
260_123286_000006_000004 Is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed?
260_123286_000042_000000 "Yes," replied my uncle, "and there is a sea lizard of vast size."
260_123286_000053_000000 "Surely you must be mistaken," I cried.
260_123286_000061_000005 The spray almost blinds us.
260_123286_000049_000002 But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray-the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise.
260_123286_000019_000000 "But I don't care for prospects.
260_123286_000048_000000 We stood dumb with fear.
260_123286_000060_000003 We remain motionless, ready to fire.
260_123286_000054_000000 "No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a lizard's head, a crocodile's teeth; and hence our mistake.
260_123286_000037_000002 Hans was at the helm.
260_123286_000020_000000 I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260_123286_000017_000003 Did he cross it?
260_123286_000004_000000 My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.
260_123286_000061_000004 The water is splashed for a long way around.
260_123286_000061_000006 But soon the reptile's agony draws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep.
260_123286_000012_000001 I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide."
260_123286_000059_000002 The two beasts are fast locked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other.
260_123286_000035_000000 I look at our guns and see that they are all right.
260_123286_000057_000000 Hans had spoken truly.
260_123286_000040_000001 I looked and cried:
260_123286_000019_000001 I came with an object, and I mean to attain it.
260_123286_000036_000002 We must be on the look out.
260_123286_000021_000005 I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim, or fail altogether.
260_123286_000045_000001 We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
260_123286_000060_000001 The struggle continues with unabated ferocity.
260_123286_000051_000000 "What two?
260_123286_000021_000007 The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
260_123286_000049_000000 At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought.
260_123286_000047_000001 The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260_123286_000040_000000 Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away, rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.
260_123286_000014_000000 "We are not descending as we ought to be," the Professor declares. "We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft."
260_123286_000023_000000 My uncle took soundings several times.
260_123286_000007_000000 "-You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
260_123286_000006_000002 And yet, what cause was there for anger?
260_123286_000061_000002 I no longer see his scaly armour.
260_123440_000018_000002 That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to day.'
260_123440_000010_000001 How queer everything is to day!
260_123440_000007_000000 Poor Alice!
260_123440_000021_000001 The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings.
260_123440_000010_000002 And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
260_123440_000024_000000 'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
260_123440_000005_000000 Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
260_123440_000010_000004 I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
260_123440_000014_000004 I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
260_123440_000023_000000 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.
260_123440_000003_000002 And how odd the directions will look!
260_123440_000002_000000 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
260_123440_000024_000001 'As if I would talk on such a subject!
260_123440_000023_000001 And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
260_123440_000001_000000 CHAPTER two.
260_123440_000015_000001 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought.
260_123440_000024_000002 Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
260_123440_000011_000006 I must have been changed for Mabel!
260_123440_000023_000003 'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.'
260_123440_000002_000001 Good bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
260_123440_000002_000004 Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
260_123440_000022_000000 'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
260_123440_000025_000002 A little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
260_123440_000014_000000 'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
260_123440_000014_000002 It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then?
260_123440_000011_000003 I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
260_123440_000001_000001 The Pool of Tears
260_123440_000011_000005 I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome-no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
260_123440_000026_000000 So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!
260_123440_000011_000004 Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-oh dear!
260_123440_000024_000003 Don't let me hear the name again!'
260_123440_000022_000001 'Would YOU like cats if you were me?'
260_123440_000008_000000 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!
260_123440_000010_000003 Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
260_123440_000011_000000 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!
260_123440_000019_000000 Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
260_123440_000015_000000 As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
260_123440_000020_000000 'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out of the way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?
260_123440_000014_000001 No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!
1320_122612_000024_000001 Yet that is not the footstep of an Indian! the weight is too much on the heel, and the toes are squared, as though one of the French dancers had been in, pigeon winging his tribe!
1320_122612_000030_000002 Pursuing the direction given by this discovery, he entered the neighboring thicket, and struck the trail, as fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring.
1320_122612_000057_000000 "How now, friend! have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?"
1320_122612_000010_000000 "'tis the trail!" exclaimed the scout, advancing to the spot; "the lad is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years."
1320_122612_000048_000002 Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?"
1320_122612_000032_000000 "Shall we proceed?" demanded Heyward.
1320_122612_000020_000000 Hawkeye and the Mohicans now applied themselves to their task in good earnest.
1320_122612_000056_000006 Instead of taking the alarm, the unconscious savage stretched forward his neck, as if he also watched the movements about the gloomy lake, with a sort of silly curiosity.
1320_122612_000006_000000 After proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the advance, became more deliberate and watchful.
1320_122612_000009_000001 Chingachgook had caught the look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak.
1320_122612_000038_000000 From such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the truth, with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated. Cheered by these assurances, and satisfied by a reasoning that was so obvious, while it was so simple, the party resumed its course, after making a short halt, to take a hurried repast.
1320_122612_000023_000002 The sticks were removed, and the stones lifted; for Indian cunning was known frequently to adopt these objects as covers, laboring with the utmost patience and industry, to conceal each footstep as they proceeded.
1320_122612_000039_000004 He soon stopped again, and waited for the whole party to come up.
1320_122612_000009_000004 The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement, and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
1320_122612_000055_000000 "Fire a whole platoon, major."
1320_122612_000033_000000 "Softly, softly, we know our path; but it is good to examine the formation of things.
1320_122612_000044_000003 A ragged calico mantle half encircled his body, while his nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt, the sleeves of which were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more commodious arrangement.
1320_122612_000020_000003 The impressions of footsteps were numerous, but they all appeared like those of men who had wandered about the spot, without any design to quit it.
1320_122612_000024_000002 Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of the singer's foot.
1320_122612_000020_000001 A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
1320_122612_000016_000004 But while the earth was trodden, and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly visible around the place, the trail appeared to have suddenly ended.
1320_122612_000027_000000 "But," cried Duncan, "I see no signs of-"
1320_122612_000015_000000 The spirits of the scout, and the astonishing success of the chase, in which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed, did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party.
1320_122612_000001_000000 CHAPTER twenty one
1320_122612_000046_000000 "You see we have reached their settlement or encampment," whispered the young man; "and here is one of the savages himself, in a very embarrassing position for our further movements."
1320_122612_000039_000003 Before an hour had elapsed, however, the speed of Hawkeye sensibly abated, and his head, instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look, began to turn suspiciously from side to side, as if he were conscious of approaching danger.
1320_122612_000043_000001 Recovering his recollection on the instant, instead of sounding an alarm, which might prove fatal to himself, he remained stationary, an attentive observer of the other's motions.
1320_122612_000044_000005 Altogether, the appearance of the individual was forlorn and miserable.
1320_122612_000037_000000 "Of that there is little cause of fear," returned the scout, slowly shaking his head; "this is a firm and straight, though a light step, and not over long.
1320_122612_000044_000000 An instant of calm observation served to assure Duncan that he was undiscovered.
1320_122612_000040_000001 If anything should happen, the call will be three croaks of a crow.
1320_122612_000035_000006 By the Lord, it is no longer than a child's and yet the maidens are tall and comely.
1320_122612_000056_000003 Having reached within a few yards of the latter, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly.
1320_122612_000028_000000 "The gentle ones," interrupted the scout; "the varlet has found a way to carry them, until he supposed he had thrown any followers off the scent. My life on it, we see their pretty little feet again, before many rods go by."
1320_122612_000047_000001 Then lowering the dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny that was already intensely keen.
1320_122612_000002_000000 "If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death." --Merry Wives of Windsor.
1320_122612_000008_000002 Has Uncas no counsel to offer in such a strait?"
1320_122612_000035_000007 That Providence is partial in its gifts, for its own wise reasons, the best and most contented of us must allow."
1320_122612_000017_000000 It was easy to follow the tracks of the Narragansetts, but they seemed only to have wandered without guides, or any other object than the pursuit of food.
1320_122612_000005_000001 The dews were suffered to exhale, and the sun had dispersed the mists, and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest, when the travelers resumed their journey.
1320_122612_000024_000003 You will find a beautiful print of it just opposite yon rock, agin the hillside."
1320_122612_000033_000001 This is my schooling, major; and if one neglects the book, there is little chance of learning from the open land of Providence.
1320_122612_000019_000003 No, no; I have heard that the French Indians had come into these hills to hunt the moose, and we are getting within scent of their camp. Why should they not?
1320_122612_000021_000000 "Such cunning is not without its deviltry," exclaimed Hawkeye, when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
1320_122612_000006_000001 He often stopped to examine the trees; nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters. Distrusting his own judgment, his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgook were frequent and earnest.
1320_122612_000009_000000 The young Mohican cast a glance at his father, but, maintaining his quiet and reserved mien, he continued silent.
1320_122612_000056_000007 In the meantime, the uplifted hand of Hawkeye was above him.
1320_122612_000029_000001 The water soon flowed into its bed again, but watching the ground on either side, the foresters pursued their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath.
1320_122612_000030_000000 It was fortunate they did so.
1320_122612_000051_000001 Do you keep him under your rifle while I creep in behind, through the bush, and take him alive.
1320_122612_000019_000005 It is true that the horses are here, but the Hurons are gone; let us, then, hunt for the path by which they parted."
1320_122612_000014_000000 "Hound never ran on a more beautiful scent," responded the scout, dashing forward, at once, on the indicated route; "we are favored, greatly favored, and can follow with high noses.
1320_122612_000014_000002 The fellow is stricken with a judgment, and is mad!
1320_122612_000029_000000 The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rill, keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions.
1320_122612_000053_000000 "If I see you in danger, may I not risk a shot?"
1320_122612_000023_000003 Still no discovery was made. At length Uncas, whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion of the task the soonest, raked the earth across the turbid little rill which ran from the spring, and diverted its course into another channel. So soon as its narrow bed below the dam was dry, he stooped over it with keen and curious eyes.
1320_122612_000044_000002 It was impossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were concealed, though Duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage. His head was shaved, as usual, with the exception of the crown, from whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawk's wing were loosely dangling.
1320_122612_000049_000000 "He appears to have no arms; nor does he seem to be viciously inclined. Unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows, who, as you see, are dodging about the water, we have but little to fear from him."
1320_122612_000013_000000 "See!" said Uncas, pointing north and south, at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him, "the dark hair has gone toward the forest."
1320_122612_000050_000000 The scout turned to Heyward, and regarded him a moment with unconcealed amazement.
1320_122612_000037_000002 No, no; my knowledge for it, neither of them was nigh fainting, hereaway.
1320_122612_000047_000000 Hawkeye started, and dropped his rifle, when, directed by the finger of his companion, the stranger came under his view.
1320_122612_000035_000003 Here we have three pair of moccasins, and two of little feet.
1320_122612_000037_000001 See, the heel has hardly touched the ground; and there the dark hair has made a little jump, from root to root.
1320_122612_000051_000002 Fire on no account."
1320_122612_000035_000005 Pass me the thong of buckskin, Uncas, and let me take the length of this foot.
1320_122612_000006_000002 During one of these conferences Heyward observed that Uncas stood a patient and silent, though, as he imagined, an interested listener.
1320_122612_000040_000000 "I scent the Hurons," he said, speaking to the Mohicans; "yonder is open sky, through the treetops, and we are getting too nigh their encampment. Sagamore, you will take the hillside, to the right; Uncas will bend along the brook to the left, while I will try the trail.
1320_122612_000006_000004 At last the scout spoke in English, and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation.
1320_122612_000023_000001 Not a leaf was left unturned.
1320_122612_000051_000000 Repeating the words, "Fellows who are dodging about the water!" he added, "so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements! The knave has long legs, though, and shall not be trusted.
1320_122612_000040_000002 I saw one of the birds fanning himself in the air, just beyond the dead oak-another sign that we are approaching an encampment."
1320_122612_000056_000000 In the next moment he was concealed by the leaves.
1320_122612_000056_000002 Then he reappeared, creeping along the earth, from which his dress was hardly distinguishable, directly in the rear of his intended captive.
1320_122612_000007_000001 Human natur' is weak, and it is possible we may not have taken the proper scent."
1320_122617_000037_000000 "Whither?"
1320_122617_000001_000000 CHAPTER twenty six
1320_122617_000057_000001 Hold your head down, and draw in your legs; their formation might tell the truth too early.
1320_122617_000013_000001 Now let us to business."
1320_122617_000047_000000 "For what?"
1320_122617_000055_000002 If you stay, it must be to sit down here in the shadow, and take the part of Uncas, until such times as the cunning of the Indians discover the cheat, when, as I have already said, your times of trial will come.
1320_122617_000055_000003 So choose for yourself-to make a rush or tarry here."
1320_122617_000043_000001 So, Uncas, you had better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again, and trust to cunning for want of speed."
1320_122617_000059_000000 The scout hesitated, and appeared to muse.
1320_122617_000049_000001 But I thought I would make the offer, seeing that youth commonly loves life.
1320_122617_000032_000000 "Hawkeye!"
1320_122617_000067_000001 'twas nothing but wonderment."
1320_122617_000030_000002 The scout, who had left David at the door, to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
1320_122617_000033_000000 "Cut his bands," said Hawkeye to David, who just then approached them.
1320_122617_000021_000001 But it was not the policy of Hawkeye to affect the least concealment.
1320_122617_000017_000000 "Can you lead me to him?"
1320_122617_000022_000001 Still they betrayed no intention to depart.
1320_122617_000067_000000 "Hold!" said the scout, grasping his friend by the shoulder, "let them yell again!
1320_122617_000069_000000 "Now let the devils strike our scent!" said the scout, tearing two rifles, with all their attendant accouterments, from beneath a bush, and flourishing "killdeer" as he handed Uncas his weapon; "two, at least, will find it to their deaths."
1320_122617_000029_000001 Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position, and slowly entered the place. It was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire, which had been used for the purposed of cookery.
1320_122617_000046_000000 "Uncas will stay," was the calm reply.
1320_122617_000064_000002 The little knot of Indians drew back in a body, and suffered, as they thought, the conjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed.
1320_122617_000027_000002 But the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and growled:
672_122797_000057_000002 All passed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot to look to himself.
672_122797_000053_000000 "No," said the Tree.
672_122797_000030_000000 "What are they about?" thought the Tree.
672_122797_000000_000000 THE FIR TREE
672_122797_000024_000001 "How it will shine this evening!"
672_122797_000002_000002 What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.
672_122797_000020_000003 Were Christmas but come!
672_122797_000028_000000 "Help!
672_122797_000011_000002 What is it like?"
8555_284447_000019_000001 The knife was built into a huge framework, like a derrick, that reached to the ceiling, and it was so arranged that when the Boolooroo pulled a cord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two the person who stood under it.
8555_284447_000058_000000 The sailor followed and pulled out the Boolooroo, who, when he saw the terrible goat was captured and tied fast, quickly recovered his courage.
8555_284447_000043_000000 "First, bind the Earth Man in the frame," commanded the Boolooroo. "We'll slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat."
8555_284447_000034_000000 So the Captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful, for he did not know who would be the victim, and if the Boolooroo had no friends, the Captain had plenty, and did not wish to see them patched.
8555_284447_000035_000000 Meantime Trot, being invisible to all, was roaming around the room and behind a bench she found a small coil of rope, which she picked up.
8555_284447_000028_000000 The Captain of the Guards hesitated to obey this order.
8555_284447_000018_000002 The poor Queen, by the way, was seldom seen, as she passed all her time playing solitaire with a deck that was one card short, hoping that before she had lived her entire six hundred years she would win the game.
8555_284447_000048_000000 When all was in readiness the King pulled the cord a second time and Trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope.
8555_284447_000015_000000 "What's become of Tiggle?" he shouted.
8555_284447_000022_000000 "Papa," exclaimed Turquoise, angrily, "can you not prevent this vile Earth Being from addressing us?
8555_284447_000041_000002 Glorious!" cried the Boolooroo, wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes.
8555_284447_000032_000000 "I can't think of anyone just now, your Spry and Flighty High and Mighty Majesty," he answered.
8555_284447_000033_000002 But I'm the Ruler here, and I'll do as I please.
8555_284447_000015_000003 Go at once, you dummies, and find him-or it will go hard with you!"
8555_284447_000050_000001 At once the goat gave a leap, escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the Boolooroo.
8555_284447_000019_000002 And, in order that the slicing would be accurate, there was another frame, to which the prisoner was tied so that he couldn't wiggle either way.
8555_284447_000018_000003 Therefore her Majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.
8555_284447_000039_000000 The Boolooroo stared a moment and then he fell back in his throne, laughing boisterously.
8555_284447_000013_000000 After breakfast was over a procession was formed, headed by the Boolooroo, and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the Room of the Great Knife.
8555_284447_000009_000000 "I wouldn't mind a cup o' coffee myself," said Cap'n Bill.
8555_284447_000063_000002 "I'll have revenge!--I'll-I'll-"
8555_284447_000029_000000 "Suppose it's a friend?" he suggested.
8555_284447_000046_000000 "Huh!" exclaimed the Boolooroo; "that's queer.
8555_284447_000026_000001 Immediately the Boolooroo flew into another towering rage.
8555_284447_000046_000001 Roll him up again, soldiers."
8555_284447_000065_000000 "Hold him steady in the frame and I'll tie him up," she replied.
8555_284447_000036_000001 Then the door flew open and in came the soldiers dragging a great blue billygoat, which was desperately striving to get free.
8555_284447_000008_000000 "So ho!" roared the monarch, "you thought you could defy me, Earth Clod, did you?
8555_284447_000023_000000 "Control yourselves, my dears," replied the Boolooroo; "the worst punishment I know how to inflict on anyone, this prisoner is about to suffer.
8555_284447_000033_000001 "Everyone hates me, and I don't object to that because I hate everybody.
8555_284447_000031_000000 The Captain shook his head.
8555_284447_000063_000000 "Stop it!
8555_284447_000020_000004 They marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact, and Cap'n Bill bowed to them politely and said:
8555_284447_000025_000001 As soon as the soldiers return with Tiggle," said he.
8555_284447_000019_000003 This frame was on rollers, so that it could be placed directly underneath the knife.
8555_284447_000045_000000 But while this was going on Trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which Cap'n Bill was confined.
8555_284447_000033_000003 Go and capture the first living creature you see, and bring him here to be patched to Cap'n Bill."
8555_284447_000039_000001 The idea of patching Cap'n Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter.
8555_284447_000054_000001 But it were a pretty close call an' I hope it won't happen again.
8555_284447_000011_000001 But Cap'n Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.
8555_284447_000012_000000 Trot was in the room, too, standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save Cap'n Bill from being patched.
8555_284447_000041_000003 "We will proceed with the Ceremony of Patching at once."
8555_284447_000035_000001 Then she seated herself in an out of the way place and quietly waited.
8555_284447_000039_000003 This would indeed be a severe punishment; therefore the Princesses were pleased at the thought of Cap'n Bill's becoming half a billygoat, and the billygoat's being half Cap'n Bill.
8555_284447_000060_000000 "Don't mind him, Cap'n," said Trot, "but fetch him along to the frame."
8555_284447_000022_000001 It is an insult to be spoken to by one about to be patched."
8555_284447_000033_000000 "Of course not," said the Boolooroo.
8555_284447_000045_000001 Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo, and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away, so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air.
8555_284447_000038_000000 "Why, you said to fetch the first living creature we met, and that was this billygoat," replied the Captain, panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns.
8555_284447_000053_000003 He nodded cheerfully, then, and said:
8555_284447_000027_000000 "Villains!" he shouted, "go out and arrest the first living thing you meet, and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to Cap'n Bill."
8555_284447_000050_000000 As he stood, bent nearly double, his back was toward the billygoat, which, in their interest and excitement, the soldiers were holding in a careless manner.
8555_284447_000041_000000 "Splendid!
8555_284447_000067_000000 "All right, Cap'n," she said in a satisfied tone, "I guess we can run this Blue Country ourselves, after this."
8555_284447_000020_000000 While Trot was observing this dreadful machine the door opened and in walked the Six Snubnosed Princesses, all in a row and with their chins up, as if they disdained everyone but themselves.
8555_284447_000013_000001 Invisible Trot followed soberly after them, still wondering what she could do to save her friend.
8555_284447_000010_000001 My guards are not to be trusted, and I don't mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched."
8555_284447_000066_000000 Then they rolled the frame in position underneath the Great Knife and Trot held in her hand the cord which would release it.
8555_284447_000008_000002 No one can resist the Mighty Boolooroo of the Blues, so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands.
8555_284447_000039_000002 Some of the soldiers laughed, too, being tickled with the absurd notion, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously.
8555_284447_000047_000001 The immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven Blueskins to raise it.
8555_284447_000050_000002 Before any could stop him he butted his Majesty so furiously that the King soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning.
8555_284447_000012_000001 No one could see her, so no one-not even Cap'n Bill-knew she was there.
8555_284447_000020_000003 Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing.
8555_284447_000015_000001 "Where's Tiggle?
8555_284447_000036_000000 Suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling.
8555_284447_000020_000002 These plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the Princesses took.
8555_284447_000049_000002 When this had been accomplished the Boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away-seemingly of its own accord-and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before.
8555_284447_000059_000000 "Hi, there!" he cried; "where are my soldiers?
8555_284447_000047_000000 The soldiers again rolled the frame in position, having first pulled the Great Knife once more to the top of the derrick.
8555_284447_000016_000000 The frightened soldiers hurried away to find Tiggle, and Trot was well pleased because she knew Tiggle was by this time safely hidden.
8555_284447_000005_000002 While he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull, hoping to hurt Cap'n Bill's big toe and make him yell; but as no response came to this mean action the Boolooroo finally looked into the room, only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped.
8555_284447_000049_000000 Now, indeed, the Boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed.
8555_284447_000049_000001 He jumped down from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the Great Knife into position.
8555_284447_000041_000001 Fine!
8555_284447_000051_000001 Finding himself free, he turned and assaulted the soldiers, butting them so fiercely that they tumbled down in bunches and as soon as they could rise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if a fiend was after them.
8555_284447_000025_000000 "When?
8555_284447_000018_000000 The Room of the Great Knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
8555_284447_000017_000000 The Boolooroo stamped up and down the room, muttering threats and declaring Cap'n Bill should be patched whether Tiggle was found or not, and while they waited Trot took time to make an inspection of the place, which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight.
8555_284447_000056_000000 "As how?" he asked, stepping from the frame.
8555_284447_000008_000001 But you were mistaken.
8555_284447_000018_000001 In one place-at the head of the room-was a raised platform for the royal family, with elegant throne chairs for the King and Queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the Snubnosed Princesses.
8555_284447_000010_000000 "Very well," replied the Boolooroo, "you shall eat with me, for then I can keep an eye on you.
8555_284447_000008_000003 Hold him fast, my men, and as soon as I've had my coffee and oatmeal I'll take him to the Room of the Great Knife and patch him."
8555_284447_000014_000000 As soon as they entered the Room of the Great Knife the Boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment.
8555_284447_000065_000001 So Cap'n Bill held the Boolooroo, and the girl tied him fast in position, as Cap'n Bill had been tied, so that his Majesty couldn't wiggle at all.
8555_284447_000048_000001 The same thing happened as before.
8555_284447_000044_000001 Then they rolled the frame underneath the Great Knife and handed the Boolooroo the cord that released the blade.
8555_284447_000048_000002 Cap'n Bill rolled away in his frame and the knife fell harmlessly.
8555_284447_000003_000000 THE AMAZING CONQUEST OF THE BLUES
8555_284447_000042_000001 Trot was horrified, and wrung her little hands in sore perplexity, for this was a most horrible fate that awaited her dear old friend.
8555_284447_000059_000001 What do you mean, prisoner, by daring to lay hands upon me?
8555_284447_000064_000000 "You'll take it easy, 'cause you can't help yourself," said Cap'n Bill. "What next, Queen Trot?"
8555_292519_000008_000000 [YOU THOUGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN]
8555_292519_000014_000000 VENICE
8555_292519_000015_000000 In a sunset glowing of crimson and gold, She lies, the glory of the world, A beached king's galley, whose sails are furled, Who is hung with tapestries rich and old.
8555_292519_000009_000000 You thought I had forgotten.
8555_292519_000011_000000 Suddenly I was back in the old days Before you felt we ought to drift apart. It was some trick-the way your eyebrows raise,
8555_292519_000025_000000 And ah! that moon of silver sheen! It is my heart hung in the sky; And no clouds ever float between The grave flowers and my heart on high.
8555_292519_000022_000000 The pleasant graveyard of my soul With sentimental cypress trees And flowers is filled, that I may stroll In meditation, at my ease.
8555_292519_000012_000000 Your hands-some vivid trifle.
8555_292519_000010_000000 The other day at someone's tea we met, Smiling gayly, bowed, and went our several ways, Complacent with successful coldness.--Yet
8555_292519_000039_000000 --That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark. More tightly under his cloak, he clasped his guitar.
8555_292519_000012_000001 With a start Then I remembered how I lived alone, Writing bad poems and eating out my heart
8555_292519_000045_000000 A little pagan child god plays Beyond the far horizon haze, And underneath the twilight trees He blows a bubble to the breeze, Which is borne upward in the night And makes the heavens shine with light. But soon it sinks to earth again, And, hitting hills, it bursts!
8555_292519_000020_000000 And still the sensitive silhouettes Of the gondolas pass and leave no track, Light on the tides as lilies, and black In the rippling waters of long sunsets.
8555_292519_000028_000000 TO WAR
8555_292519_000009_000001 Well, I had! (Although I never guessed I could forget Those few great moments when we both went mad.)
8555_292519_000029_000000 The music beats, up the chasmed street, Then flares from around the curve; The cheers break out from the waving crowd: --Our soldiers march, superb! Over the track lined city street The young men, the grinning men, pass.
8555_292519_000037_000001 He had got into her courtyard. She was alone that night. Through the black night rain, he sang to her window bars:
8555_292519_000041_000000 She was alone that night. He had broken into her courtyard. Above the gurgling gutters he heard- surely- a door unchained?
8555_292519_000026_000000 I do not read upon each stone The name that once was carven there; I merely note new blossoms blown And breathe the perfume of the air.
8555_292519_000046_000000 THRENODY
8555_292519_000047_000000 She is lain with high things and with low. She lies With shut eyes, Rocked in the eternal flow Of silence evermore.
8555_292519_000043_000000 "A good old tune," she murmured --and I found we were dancing.
8555_292519_000003_000000 You are the star that made the skies all bright, Yet tore itself away in flaming flight; You are the tree that suddenly awoke; You are the rose that came to life and spoke....
8555_292519_000045_000001 And then With foam the skies are splashed and sprayed; And that's how all the stars are made.
8555_292519_000033_000000 Always the ships that move in mystery, on the dim horizon, Shadow filled sails of dreams, sliding over the blue grey ocean, Far from the rock edged shore where willow green waves are rushing, And white foam people leap, to stand erect for the moment.
8555_292519_000006_000000 And when the fireflies mix their circling glow Through the dark plants, then gently might I know Your lips, light as the wings of the dragon flies....
8555_292519_000035_000000 PHONOGRAPH-TANGO
8555_292519_000005_000000 There we might wander, you and I alone, Through gardens filled with marble seats moss grown, And fountains-water threads that winds disperse- While in the spray the birds sit and converse.
8555_292519_000048_000000 Desperately immortal, she; She stands With wide hands Dim through the veil of eternity, Behind the supreme door.
8555_292519_000004_000000 Guided by you, how we might stroll towards death, Our only music one another's breath, Through gardens intimate with hollyhocks, Where silent poppies burn between the rocks, By pools where birches bend to confidants Above green waters scummed with lily plants.
8555_292519_000031_000000 Another band beats down the street; Contending rhythms clash; New melodies win place, then fade, And the flashing legs move past. Down the cheering, grey paved street The fringed flags, the erect flags, pass.
8555_292519_000032_000000 CALM DAY, WITH ROLLERS
8555_292519_000027_000000 Thus walk I through my wonderland While all the evening is atune, Beneath the cypress trees that stand Like candles to the barren moon.
8555_284449_000033_000000 "You are, mate," replied the sailor.
8555_284449_000031_000001 But before I do that I want the privilege of patching the Snubnosed Princesses to each other-mixing the six as much as possible-and then I want to patch the former Boolooroo to the billygoat, which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon Cap'n Bill."
8555_284449_000039_000000 When the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer, for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked Ruler.
8555_284449_000007_000001 Then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the Army of Pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them.
8555_284449_000061_000000 "I think it will be best for us to go back to our own country as soon as possible," suggested Rosalie the Witch; "for, if we stay here very long, the Blueskins may rise against us and cause the Pinkies much trouble."
8555_284449_000037_000001 "Guess I'd better send for him an' tell him what's happened."
8555_284449_000053_000001 It isn't a very pretty cabin and the furniture is cheap and common, but I'm sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his family."
8555_284449_000017_000001 All of Sky Island, except the Fog Bank, is now my kingdom, so I welcome my faithful Pinkies to my Blue City, where you are to be royally entertained and have a good time.
8555_284449_000050_000000 "Not even a bird cage," said she.
8555_284449_000043_000000 As they led the now famous animal from the room the Boolooroo shuddered and said:
8555_284449_000028_000000 After they had eaten all they could, and the servants had been sent away, Trot related her adventures, telling how, with the assistance of the billygoat, she had turned the tables on the wicked Boolooroo.
8555_284449_000051_000001 "Won't you please get rid of them, too, your Majesty?
8555_284449_000006_000000 The soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the palace in marching order, so Trot and Cap'n Bill headed the procession, and then came the soldiers-all keeping step-and then the bands, playing very loud noises on their instruments, and finally the crowd of Blue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully.
8555_284449_000044_000001 I'm the Boolooroo!"
8555_284449_000044_000000 "How dare you people give orders in my palace?
8555_284449_000057_000000 This was done, the once royal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks.
8555_284449_000040_000001 "It's my idee as he's braver than the whole Blue Army put together."
8555_284449_000025_000002 I'm nearly starved, myself, for this conquerin' kingdoms is hard work."
8555_284449_000015_000000 "Stop it!" said Button Bright; "I can't hear myself think."
8555_284449_000046_000000 The former Boolooroo groaned.
8555_284449_000058_000002 All the rubbish was piled in the square before the palace and a bonfire made of it, while the Blue people clustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames devoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much unhappiness.
8555_284449_000041_000000 "You're right, Cap'n," she returned.
8555_284449_000024_000000 Trot had listened carefully to the Majordomo's speech.
8555_284449_000042_000000 "I'll gladly do that," promised the new Boolooroo; "and I'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass.
8555_284449_000007_000000 In this order they proceeded to the main gate, which Trot ordered the guards to throw wide open.
8555_284449_000025_000000 "Don't worry, Sizzle dear; it'll all come right pretty soon.
8555_284449_000020_000003 But the people called upon him for a speech, so he faced the Blueskins and said:
8555_284449_000032_000000 "No," said Trot, positively, "there's been enough patching in this country and I won't have any more of it.
8555_284449_000041_000001 "I'll have 'Sizzle make a fine yard for the goat, where he'll have plenty of blue grass to eat.
8555_284449_000047_000001 "Am I to be patched, or what?"
8555_284449_000038_000000 So the Captain of the Guards was given the key and told to fetch the Boolooroo from the Room of the Great Knife.
8555_284449_000058_000000 Then the Room of the Great Knife was cleared of its awful furniture.
8555_284449_000009_000000 However, as the two forces came nearer together, Button Bright spied Trot and Cap'n Bill standing before the enemy, and the sight astonished him considerably.
8555_284449_000045_000003 He'll look after this end of the Island hereafter, an' unless I'm much mistaken he'll do it a heap better than you did."
8555_284449_000051_000002 Can't they be discharged?"
8555_284449_000038_000001 The guards had a terrible struggle with the goat, which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight, but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the Boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before Queen Trot, who awaited them in the throne room of the palace.
8555_284449_000048_000000 "You won't be hurt," answered the girl, "but you'll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace, an' perhaps you'll enjoy workin' for a livin, by way of variety."
8555_284449_000021_000000 "I escaped from the City because the Boolooroo tried to patch me, as you all know, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses tried to marry me, which would have been a far greater misfortune.
8555_284449_000034_000001 It will be such a satisfaction."
8555_284449_000029_000001 I'll always be Queen of Sky Island, but the Pink and Blue Countries must each have a Ruler.
8555_284449_000011_000000 "Hooray!" yelled the parrot,
8555_284449_000017_000000 "Pinkies," said she, "your Queen has conquered the Boolooroo and is now the Queen of the Blues.
8555_284449_000035_000001 "You let the poor old Boolooroo alone.
8555_284449_000023_000000 "Here's a pretty howdy do- You haven't any Boolooroo!"
8555_284449_000028_000001 Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them.
8555_284449_000059_000001 The combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served.
8555_284449_000035_000000 "I have said no, an' I mean it," answered the girl.
8555_284449_000013_000000 and then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight, and added as fast as his bird's tongue could speak:
8555_284449_000020_000002 He was looking downcast and sad, and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he had not conquered the Boolooroo himself.
8555_284449_000024_000001 When he finished she said cheerfully:
8555_284449_000045_000000 "'Scuse me," said Trot; "I neglected to tell you that you're not the Boolooroo any more.
8555_284449_000049_000000 "Can't I take any of the treasure with me?" he pleaded.
8555_284449_000055_000001 When first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever, but the Blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them, for there was not a single person in all the Blue Country who loved the Princesses the least little bit.
5142_36600_000010_000001 All the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed by mr Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice.
5142_36600_000012_000003 The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the degrees of difference between the parents in external structure or habits of life.
5142_36600_000009_000000 Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions.
5142_36600_000006_000000 Now let us apply these generally admitted principles to the races of man, viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other animal.
5142_36600_000008_000007 Even some of the most strongly marked races cannot be identified with that degree of unanimity which might have been expected from what has been written on the subject.
5142_36600_000010_000006 These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European lice.
5142_36600_000007_000008 Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual faculties.
5142_36600_000011_000000 Our supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation, would next enquire whether the races of men, when crossed, were in any degree sterile.
5142_36600_000006_000004 Father Ripa makes exactly the same remark with respect to the Chinese.); and the Hindoo cannot at first perceive any difference between the several European nations.
5142_36600_000005_000001 Geographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and sometimes consciously; so that forms living in two widely separated areas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically distinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in truth this affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called good or true species.
5142_36600_000001_000000 CHAPTER seven.
5142_36600_000010_000000 In determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is, whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct.
5142_36600_000011_000012 dr Rohlfs writes to me that he found the mixed races in the Great Sahara, derived from Arabs, Berbers, and Negroes of three tribes, extraordinarily fertile.
5142_36600_000004_000004 Even a slight degree of sterility between any two forms when first crossed, or in their offspring, is generally considered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness; and their continued persistence without blending within the same area, is usually accepted as sufficient evidence, either of some degree of mutual sterility, or in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to pairing.
5142_36600_000010_000005 These Pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America, of which he gave me specimens.
5142_36600_000012_000013 It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that the acme of sterility, when the germen alone is affected, cannot have been gained through selection.
5142_36600_000007_000007 The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases.
5142_36600_000010_000004 In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course of three or four days.
5142_36600_000010_000008 In these latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts.
5142_36600_000010_000007 mr Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and Kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and two from South America.
5142_36600_000008_000014 They give also corroborative evidence; but c Vogt thinks that the subject requires further investigation.), that the human skulls found in the caves of Brazil, entombed with many extinct mammals, belonged to the same type as that now prevailing throughout the American Continent.
5142_36600_000012_000001 We know that these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life, or by close inter breeding, and that they are governed by highly complex laws, for instance, that of the unequal fertility of converse crosses between the same two species.
5142_36600_000012_000002 With forms which must be ranked as undoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are absolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or completely fertile.
5142_36600_000006_000007 Nevertheless, these men, if seen alive, would undoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we are clearly much influenced in our judgment by the mere colour of the skin and hair, by slight differences in the features, and by expression.
5142_36377_000011_000001 A young lady quietly joined the party at the supper table.
5142_36377_000004_000000 My room was clean-oppressively clean.
5142_36377_000016_000001 He looked up at Naomi doubtingly from his plate, and looked down again slowly with a frown. When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly.
5142_36377_000017_000002 When the two sons seized a stray remark of mine about animals in general, and applied it satirically to the mismanagement of sheep and oxen in particular, they looked at john Jago, while they talked to me.
5142_36377_000019_000001 I wish you good night."
5142_36377_000008_000005 "A little cracked"--that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room.
5142_36377_000017_000005 A more dreary and more disunited family party I never sat at the table with.
5142_36377_000015_000000 The supper was not a merry one.
5142_36377_000008_000000 He was short, spare, and wiry; singularly pale for a person whose life was passed in the country.
5142_36377_000012_000002 Naomi Colebrook at last!
5142_36377_000002_000001 I followed the groom up to my room, not over well pleased with my first experience of the farm.
5142_36377_000006_000006 I set them down as men with undeveloped qualities, waiting (the good and evil qualities alike) for time and circumstances to bring them to their full growth.
5142_36377_000010_000004 I hope you have no prejudice against Americans.
5142_36377_000016_000002 Even when he spoke to mr Meadowcroft, he was still on his guard-on his guard against the two young men, as I fancied by the direction which his eyes took on these occasions.
5142_36377_000013_000002 Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.
5142_36377_000008_000001 The face was in other respects, besides this, a striking face to see.
5142_36377_000013_000001 Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well carried, and well set on her shoulders; bright gray eyes, that looked at you honestly, and meant what they looked; a trim, slight little figure-too slight for our English notions of beauty; a strong American accent; and (a rare thing in America) a pleasantly toned voice, which made the accent agreeable to English ears.
5142_36377_000014_000000 For once in a way, I proved a true prophet.
5142_36377_000006_000005 But there was no marked character in either face.
5142_36377_000010_000002 He is not well; he has come over the ocean for rest, and change of scene.
5142_36377_000004_000002 My library was limited to the Bible and the Prayer Book.
5142_36377_000014_000003 She changed color for a moment, and looked at him, with a pretty, reluctant tenderness, as she took her chair.
5142_36377_000013_000000 A pretty girl, and, so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl too.
5142_36377_000006_000000 mr Meadowcroft's invalid chair had been wheeled to the head of the table.
5142_36377_000004_000006 My spirits sank as I looked round me.
5142_36377_000000_000003 She was a melancholy, middle aged woman, without visible attractions of any sort-one of those persons who appear to accept the obligation of living under protest, as a burden which they would never have consented to bear if they had only been consulted first.
5142_36377_000016_000003 When we began our meal, I had noticed for the first time that Silas Meadowcroft's left hand was strapped up with surgical plaster; and I now further observed that john Jago's wandering brown eyes, furtively looking at everybody round the table in turn, looked with a curious, cynical scrutiny at the young man's injured hand.
5142_36377_000011_000000 The door opened once more.
5142_36377_000013_000003 I liked Naomi Colebrook at first sight; liked her pleasant smile; liked her hearty shake of the hand when we were presented to each other.
5142_36377_000010_000006 They pointedly drew back from john Jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142_36377_000004_000012 I looked at my watch.
5142_36377_000012_000000 Was the young lady Naomi Colebrook?
5142_36377_000006_000001 On his right-hand side sat his sad and silent daughter.
5142_33396_000036_000001 Do you not think we shall be merry company?'
5142_33396_000006_000002 On the breast and sides I carved the dragon's scales.
5142_33396_000039_000001 They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked.
5142_33396_000022_000004 We went to it, and I struck it with my spear.
5142_33396_000002_000004 Ten sons sat at meat with him, and I was the youngest.
5142_33396_000008_000000 "'This is my vow: I will sail to Norway and I will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches.
5142_33396_000051_000000 "'And these shall follow your thralls in the same way.
5142_33396_000030_000001 'A fire!
5142_33396_000012_000002 As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it:
5142_33396_000039_000002 At last the supper began.
5142_33396_000014_000000 "So we harried the coast of Norway.
5142_33396_000038_000000 "'Ah!' another then cried out, sitting up.
5142_33396_000042_000001 I thought that all this night's work would be my death.'
5142_33396_000035_000000 "Off they ran through a door at the back of the hall.
5142_33396_000018_000000 "'What of the farm, Olaf?'
5142_33396_000034_000000 "'Ho, thralls!' I called to them.
5142_33396_000004_000002 But I stayed that spring and built me a boat.
5142_33396_000047_000001 Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?'
5142_33396_000038_000001 'Here comes something that will be a welcome guest to my stomach.'
5142_33396_000040_000000 "'You would not eat with us.
5142_33396_000021_000000 "'Now for the farm.
5142_33396_000040_000002 I drink this to your health.'
5142_33396_000056_000001 Their eyes danced.
5142_33396_000030_000000 "'Come, come!' I called, when no one obeyed.
5142_33396_000042_000000 "'Since it is to my health, I will drink it.
5142_33396_000012_000001 I sat high in the pilot's seat.
5142_33396_000005_000000 "'There, stand so!' I said, 'and glare and hiss at my foes.'
5142_33396_000022_000003 There was but one door to the house.
5142_33396_000034_000002 We are hungry.'
5142_33396_000006_000001 There I put the pilot's seat and a strong tiller for the rudder.
5142_33396_000039_000000 "The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat.
5142_33396_000025_000000 "At last some one from inside said:
5142_33396_000004_000001 These he gave to three of my brothers.
5142_33396_000024_000002 Hello!' I shouted, and my men made a great din.
5142_33396_000022_000000 "So we set off for it.
5142_33396_000028_000000 "The door opened only a little, but I pushed it wide and leaped into the room.
5142_33396_000048_000000 "I went on:
5142_33396_000017_000000 "Up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic.
5142_33396_000008_000002 Now who will follow me?'
5142_33396_000001_000000 The thrall's eyes flashed.
5142_33396_000016_000000 "Oh! it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals.
5142_33396_000032_000000 "'Yes, a stingy host!
5142_33396_000002_000001 There, far off, is my country, across the water.
5142_33396_000015_000000 "'My dragon's belly is never full,' and on board went the gold.
5142_33396_000049_000004 Leif and Grim shall be the same kind of friends to your two sons.'
5142_33396_000002_000003 Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle.
5142_33396_000034_000001 'Bring in the table.
5142_33396_000049_000003 He shall not leave you day or night, whether you are working or playing or sleeping.
5142_33396_000012_000000 "On the next morning we got into my dragon and started.
5142_33396_000017_000001 After a while my men said:
5142_33396_000056_000000 "All my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted.
5142_33396_000004_000000 "He had three ships.
5142_33396_000008_000001 Then I will get me a farm and will winter in that land.
5142_33396_000014_000001 We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
5142_33396_000037_000001 'What man wants to spend the winter with no guests?'
5142_33396_000039_000003 The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths. When the tables were taken out and the mead horns came round, I stood up and raised my horn and said to the farmer:
5142_33396_000014_000002 Many men we found overburdened with gold.
5142_33396_000053_000000 "Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hakon came in to the feast one night and said:
5142_33396_000033_000003 The farmer crouched by the fire, afraid to move.
5142_33396_000045_000000 "'I like this little taste of your hospitality, friend farmer.
5142_33396_000046_000000 "My men roared with laughter.
5142_33396_000010_000000 "But others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands. Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said:
5142_33396_000047_000000 "'Come,' they cried, 'thank him for that, farmer.
5142_33396_000003_000002 The eldest of you shall have my farm when I die.
5142_33396_000049_000001 So I will give out this law: that my men shall never leave you alone.
5142_33396_000024_000000 "'Hello!
5142_33396_000000_000001 Have you always been a thrall?"
5142_33396_000007_000000 "The night that it was finished I went to my father's feast.
5142_33396_000052_000003 Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck no one came that way.
5142_33396_000026_000000 "'Who calls?'
5142_33396_000004_000004 At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out.
5142_33396_000029_000000 "'Now start up the fire,' I said.
5142_33396_000036_000000 "'Well, friend farmer,' laughed one, 'why such a long face?
5142_33396_000028_000002 I stood with my back to the wall; for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me.
5142_33396_000028_000001 It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.
5142_33396_000054_000000 "'I heard a cuckoo to day!'
5142_33396_000044_000001 At last I stood up and said:
5142_33396_000033_000002 There were benches for twenty men along each side.
5142_33396_000041_000001 He took it and smiled, saying:
5142_33396_000027_000000 "'I call,' I answered.
5142_33396_000019_000001 'Viking is better for summer.
5142_33396_000052_000002 So no tales got out to the neighbors.
5142_33396_000033_000004 On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together.
5142_33396_000003_000003 The rest of you, off a viking!'
5142_33396_000052_000000 "So I set guards over every one in that house.
5142_33396_000050_000000 "I named nine others and said:
5142_33396_000019_000000 "'Not yet,' I answered.
5142_36586_000011_000000 It is well known that use strengthens the muscles in the individual, and complete disuse, or the destruction of the proper nerve, weakens them. When the eye is destroyed, the optic nerve often becomes atrophied.
5142_36586_000008_000004 Gould endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on stature; but he arrived only at negative results, namely that they did not relate to climate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor even "in any controlling degree" to the abundance or the need of the comforts of life.
5142_36586_000011_000001 When an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats.
5142_36586_000011_000002 When one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size, and does double work.
5142_36586_000009_000000 Whether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is not known.
5142_36586_000010_000000 EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS.
5142_36586_000009_000003 But this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind.
5142_36586_000008_000012 dr Beddoe has lately proved that, with the inhabitants of Britain, residence in towns and certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height; and he infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is likewise the case in the United States.
121_127105_000022_000001 "You'll easily judge," he repeated: "YOU will."
121_127105_000003_000000 THE TURN OF THE SCREW
121_127105_000028_000003 It was almost the tone of hope.
121_127105_000000_000000 This is a LibriVox recording.
121_127105_000044_000000 He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before.
121_127105_000007_000003 This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait.
121_127105_000014_000001 "For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain."
121_127105_000010_000001 "Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard.
121_127105_000011_000000 "For sheer terror?" I remember asking.
121_127105_000017_000001 You took the thing down?"
121_127105_000020_000004 But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation.
121_127105_000027_000000 "Well then; after dinner-"
121_127105_000037_000000 "She was ten years older," said her husband.
121_127105_000023_000001 "I see.
121_127105_000017_000000 "And is the record yours?
121_127105_000036_000000 He sprang to his feet again.
121_127105_000043_000000 The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun.
121_127105_000033_000000 "The story WON'T tell," said Douglas; "not in any literal, vulgar way."
121_127105_000013_000000 "Oh, how delicious!" cried one of the women.
121_127105_000044_000003 The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121_127105_000041_000000 "The outbreak," I returned, "will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;" and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for everything else.
121_127105_000043_000002 This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing-this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage.
121_127105_000042_000001 Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so.
121_127105_000020_000009 Oh yes; don't grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me, too.
121_127105_000016_000006 He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence.
121_127105_000022_000000 He continued to fix me.
121_127105_000042_000003 It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give.
121_127105_000008_000001 But it's not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child.
121_127105_000016_000002 I shall have to send to town." There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained.
121_127105_000044_000001 These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position-a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience-very heavily on his hands.
121_127105_000025_000000 "You'll receive the packet Thursday morning?" I inquired.
121_127105_000020_000006 It was long ago, and this episode was long before.
121_127105_000035_000000 "Won't YOU tell, Douglas?" somebody else inquired.
121_127105_000039_000000 "Forty years!" Griffin put in.
121_127105_000030_000002 "Who was it she was in love with?"
121_127105_000016_000009 To this his answer was prompt.
121_127105_000015_000000 "Well then," I said, "just sit right down and begin."
121_127105_000020_000001 "A woman's.
121_127105_000044_000007 She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school-young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other.
121_127105_000014_000000 He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121_127105_000043_000007 He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.
121_127105_000020_000011 She had never told anyone.
121_127105_000016_000004 It's in a locked drawer-it has not been out for years.
121_127105_000024_000002 Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been.
121_127105_000012_000002 "For dreadful-dreadfulness!"
121_127105_000012_000001 He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace.
121_127105_000024_000001 "You ARE acute.
121_127105_000016_000003 "The story's written.
121_127105_000042_000005 The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
121_127105_000019_000000 "Then your manuscript-?"
121_127105_000024_000006 He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.
121_127105_000016_000008 I adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own.
121_127105_000018_000001 I took that HERE"--he tapped his heart. "I've never lost it."
121_127105_000034_000000 "More's the pity, then.
121_127105_000041_000001 The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and "candlestuck," as somebody said, and went to bed.
121_127105_000028_000002 "Isn't anybody going?"
121_127105_000024_000000 He laughed for the first time.
121_127105_000043_000004 He was handsome and bold and pleasant, offhand and gay and kind.
121_127105_000010_000002 It's quite too horrible." This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: "It's beyond everything.
121_127105_000038_000001 But it's rather nice, his long reticence."
121_127105_000021_000000 "Because the thing had been such a scare?"
121_127105_000020_000013 I was sure; I could see.
121_127105_000030_000001 mrs Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.
121_127105_000032_000000 "Oh, I can't wait for the story!"
121_127105_000020_000002 She has been dead these twenty years.
121_127105_000040_000000 "With this outbreak at last."
121_127105_000042_000004 Poor Douglas, before his death-when it was in sight-committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth.
121_127105_000044_000004 He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment-but below stairs only-an excellent woman, mrs Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother.
121_127105_000023_000002 She was in love."
121_127105_000007_000002 It was this observation that drew from Douglas-not immediately, but later in the evening-a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121_127105_000042_000006 But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.
121_127105_000036_000001 "Yes-tomorrow.
121_127105_000012_000000 He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it.
121_127105_000043_000003 One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out.
121_127105_000016_000001 Then as he faced us again: "I can't begin.
121_127105_000036_000003 From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon mrs Griffin spoke.
121_127105_000043_000006 She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant-saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women.
121_127105_000020_000005 "She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than i She was my sister's governess," he quietly said. "She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever.
121_127105_000008_000000 "I quite agree-in regard to Griffin's ghost, or whatever it was-that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch.
121_127105_000010_000000 I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets.
121_127105_000009_000000 "We say, of course," somebody exclaimed, "that they give two turns!
121_127105_000016_000005 I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it." It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this-appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate.
121_127105_000028_000000 "You'll all meet me here?"
121_127105_000007_000004 We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.
121_127105_000016_000000 He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant.
121_127105_000036_000004 "Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who HE was."
121_127105_000026_000000 "Probably not till the second post."
121_127105_000010_000003 Nothing at all that I know touches it."
121_127105_000029_000000 "Everybody will stay!"
121_127105_000008_000002 If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to TWO children-?"
121_127105_000020_000010 If she hadn't she wouldn't have told me.
121_123859_000017_000001 now I find true That better is, by evil still made better; And ruin'd love, when it is built anew, Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater. So I return rebuk'd to my content, And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
121_121726_000007_000003 Painful to hear.

8463_294825_000040_000000 - MILLIGRAM Roughly one twenty eight thousandth of an ounce
8463_294825_000021_000001 But with Verne the operative word is "travel," and some of his best known titles don't really qualify as scifi: Around the World in Eighty Days (eighteen seventy two) and Michael Strogoff (eighteen seventy six) are closer to "travelogs"-- adventure yarns in far away places.
8463_294825_000022_000000 These observations partly apply here.
8463_294825_000038_000000 FATHOM six feet
8463_294825_000023_000003 His specifications for an open sea submarine and a self-contained diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly.
8463_294825_000050_000000 - KILOMETER Roughly six tenths of a mile
8463_294825_000022_000002 Yet this loose structure gives the novel an air of documentary realism.
8463_294825_000022_000001 The subtitle of the present book is An Underwater Tour of the World, so in good travelog style, the Nautilus's exploits supply an episodic story line. Shark attacks, giant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts, and other rip roaring adventures erupt almost at random.
8463_294825_000043_000000 KNOT one point one five miles per hour
8463_294825_000023_000000 Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight.
8463_294825_000023_000002 And Verne's marine engineering proves especially authoritative.
8463_294825_000047_000000 - MILLIMETER Roughly one twenty fifth of an inch
8463_294825_000048_000000 - CENTIMETER Roughly two fifths of an inch
8463_294825_000033_000000 Units of Measure
8463_294825_000046_000000 METER Roughly one yard, three inches
8463_294825_000035_000000 CENTIGRADE zero degrees centigrade equals freezing water
8463_294825_000020_000000 Verne is often dubbed, in Isaac Asimov's phrase, "the world's first science fiction writer." And it's true, many of his sixty odd books do anticipate future events and technologies: From the Earth to the Moon (eighteen sixty five) and Hector Servadac (eighteen seventy seven) deal in space travel, while Journey to the Center
8463_294825_000037_000000 one hundred degrees centigrade equals boiling water
8463_294825_000026_000002 This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions: he's a fighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good; he works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he himself creates a holocaust; he detests imperialism, yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole.
8463_294825_000024_000001 This notwithstanding, Verne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths before the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.
8463_294825_000018_000001 The Poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only Verne but all Europe.
8463_294825_000026_000003 And in this last action he falls into the classic sin of Pride.
8463_294825_000030_000001 Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games, the seas keep their secrets.
8463_294825_000026_000000 But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo. Inventor, musician, Renaissance genius, he's a trail blazing creation, the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in popular fiction, but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes or Wolf Larsen.
8463_294825_000015_000000 "The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us," admits Professor Aronnax early in this novel.
8463_294825_000044_000000 LEAGUE In Verne's context, two point one six miles
8463_294825_000016_000001 one hundred twenty six years later, a Time cover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission: "We know more about Mars than we know about the oceans." This reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.
8463_294825_000030_000002 We've seen progress in sonar, torpedoes, and other belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists- to say nothing of tourists-have yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and efficiency of the Nautilus.
8463_294825_000024_000000 True, today's scientists know a few things he didn't: the South Pole isn't at the water's edge but far inland; sharks don't flip over before attacking; giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight; sperm whales don't prey on their whalebone cousins.
8463_294825_000018_000000 Initially, Verne's narrative was influenced by the eighteen sixty three uprising of Poland against Tsarist Russia.
8463_294825_000025_000001 Even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn: Professor Aronnax, the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict; Conseil, the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne's fast facts; the harpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic animal.
8463_294825_000036_000000 thirty seven degrees centigrade equals human body temperature
8463_294825_000025_000000 Lastly the book has stature as a novel of character.
8463_294825_000022_000004 These unifying threads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.
8463_294825_000021_000000 of the Earth features travel to the earth's core.
8463_294825_000026_000001 However, Verne gives his hero's brilliance and benevolence a dark underside-the man's obsessive hate for his old enemy.
8463_294825_000015_000001 "What goes on in those distant depths?

8463_294825_000015_000002 What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? It's almost beyond conjecture."
8463_294825_000027_000000 Like Shakespeare's King Lear he courts death and madness in a great storm, then commits mass murder, collapses in catatonic paralysis, and suicidally runs his ship into the ocean's most dangerous whirlpool. Hate swallows him whole.
8463_294825_000042_000000 HECTARE Roughly two point five acres
8463_294825_000045_000000 LITER Roughly one quart
8463_294825_000030_000000 Because, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven't caught up with Verne.
8463_294825_000019_000000 But in the eighteen sixties France had to treat the Tsar as an ally, and Verne's publisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable. Verne reworked its political content, devising new nationalities for Nemo and his great enemy-information revealed only in a later novel, The Mysterious Island (eighteen seventy five); in the present work Nemo's background remains a dark secret.
8463_294825_000017_000001 First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages- to Britain, America, the Mediterranean.
8463_294828_000013_000001 Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it.
8463_294828_000036_000000 "They'll feed it during our absence.
8463_294828_000053_000000 I bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.
8463_294828_000032_000000 "We'll deal with them later."
8463_294828_000022_000001 He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third person-to the point where it got tiresome.
8463_294828_000039_000000 "Whatever detour master wishes."
8463_294828_000012_000000 As Master Wishes
8463_294828_000036_000001 Anyhow, we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France."
8463_294828_000040_000000 "Oh, it's nothing really!
8463_294828_000035_000000 "What about master's live babirusa?"
8463_294828_000043_000000 "What master does, I'll do," Conseil replied.
8463_294828_000049_000001 I asked for Commander Farragut.
8463_294828_000067_000000 Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City.
8463_294828_000020_000000 For the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned.
8463_294828_000046_000000 A quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready.
8463_294828_000033_000001 The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus, and master's other fossil skeletons?"
8463_294828_000021_000000 The lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty.
8463_294828_000011_000000 CHAPTER three
8463_294828_000050_000000 "Professor Pierre Aronnax?" he said to me.
8463_294828_000041_000000 "As master thinks best," Conseil replied placidly.
8463_294828_000031_000000 "What about master's collections?" Conseil ventured to observe.
8463_294828_000027_000000 "Did master summon me?" he said, entering.
8463_294828_000045_000000 "As master wishes."
8463_294828_000042_000003 We don't know where it will take us!
8463_294828_000024_000002 There was good reason to stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man. What would Conseil say?
8463_294828_000054_000002 Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour, a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.
8463_294828_000014_000002 But now nothing could hold me back. I forgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion, friends, or collections, I accepted the American government's offer.
8463_294828_000048_000001 There the Katrin ferry transferred men, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York annex located on the left bank of the East River, and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels.
8463_294828_000040_000001 A route slightly less direct, that's all. We're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln."
8463_294828_000017_000000 "Conseil!" I called in an impatient voice.
8463_294828_000038_000000 "Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ," I replied evasively, "but after we make a detour."
8463_294828_000049_000000 Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I rushed aboard.
8463_294828_000069_000000 The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.
8463_294828_000019_000000 From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. In Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification, an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses, orders, families, genera, subgenera, species, and varieties. But there his science came to a halt.
8463_294828_000023_000000 "Conseil!" I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure.
8463_294828_000047_000000 The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd.
8463_294828_000061_000000 "Are we up to pressure?" he asked the man.
8463_294828_000014_000000 Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest.
8463_294828_000015_000000 "Besides," I mused, "all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France!
8463_294828_000066_000000 The wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from five hundred thousand throats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing the Abraham
8463_294828_000028_000001 Get my things ready, get yours ready. We're departing in two hours."
8463_294828_000042_000004 These beasts can be quite unpredictable!
8463_294828_000018_000000 Conseil was my manservant.
8463_294828_000051_000001 "Commander Farragut?"
8463_294828_000052_000000 "In person.
8463_294828_000052_000002 Your cabin is waiting for you."
8463_294828_000018_000001 A devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle, habitually hardworking, rarely startled by life's surprises, very skillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite his having a name that means "counsel," never giving advice- not even the unsolicited kind!
8463_294828_000042_000001 We're going to rid the seas of it! The author of a two volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut.
8463_294828_000063_000000 "Go ahead, then!" Commander Farragut called.
8463_294828_000020_000002 Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was. He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment. Moreover, he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments, owned solid muscles, but hadn't a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves- the mental type, I mean.
8463_294828_000014_000001 I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my dearly beloved collections!
8463_294828_000024_000000 To be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad.
8463_294828_000028_000000 "Yes, my boy.
8463_294828_000033_000000 "What!
8463_294828_000034_000000 "The hotel will keep them for us."
8463_294828_000070_000000 Three o'clock then sounded.
8463_294828_000054_000000 The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment.
8463_294828_000058_000000 I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.
8463_294828_000030_000001 Pack as much into my trunk as you can, my traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don't bother counting, just squeeze it all in-and hurry!"
8463_294828_000026_000000 Conseil appeared.
8463_294828_000047_000002 I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.
8463_294828_000047_000001 I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
8463_294828_000054_000001 It was a high-speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres.
8463_294828_000022_000000 But Conseil had one flaw.
8463_294828_000057_000000 "With all due respect to master," Conseil replied, "as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk."
8463_294828_000051_000000 "The same," I replied.
8463_294828_000046_000001 Conseil did them in a flash, and I was sure the lad hadn't missed a thing, because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.
8463_294828_000025_000000 "Conseil!" I called a third time.
8463_294828_000013_000000 THREE SECONDS before the arrival of j b Hobson's letter, I no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest Passage.
8463_294828_000037_000000 "Then we aren't returning to Paris?" Conseil asked.
8463_294828_000064_000000 At this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed air device, the mechanics activated the start-up wheel. Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves.
8463_294828_000060_000001 He summoned his engineer.
8463_294828_000052_000001 Welcome aboard, professor.
8463_294828_000062_000000 "Aye, sir," the engineer replied.
8463_294828_000042_000002 It's a glorious mission but also a dangerous one!
8463_294828_000030_000000 "We haven't a moment to lose.
8463_287645_000003_000002 Nor was he all muscle by a great deal; he was well balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness.
8463_287645_000030_000002 On this occasion, with older and wiser heads, he succeeded.
8463_287645_000022_000003 I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.
8463_287645_000014_000001 "These Johnsons thought that they were first rate to their servants.
8463_287645_000024_000002 I didn't know the way to come.
8463_287645_000022_000004 He worked me very hard; he wanted to be beating me all the time."
8463_287645_000013_000003 The mistress professed to know nothing about it, simply said, 'she went to sleep and fell out herself.' As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment."
8463_287645_000015_000000 As to advertising him, john gave it as his opinion that they would be ashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves more notorious than they had bargained for, on account of their cruelty towards their slaves; they were wealthy, and courted the good opinion of society.
8463_287645_000013_000000 "Another case was that of a slave woman in a very delicate state, who was one day knocked down stairs by mrs Johnson herself, and in a few weeks after, the poor woman died from the effects of the injury thus received.
8463_287645_000024_000000 When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, "Oh my senses!
8463_287645_000006_000000 His wife and boy shared fully in his affections, and seemed well pleased to have their faces turned Canada ward.
8463_287645_000016_000000 With John's intelligence, large observation, good memory, and excellent natural abilities, with the amount of detail that he possessed, nothing more would have been needed for a thrilling book than the facts and incidents of slave life, as he had been conversant with it under the Johnsons in Maryland.
8463_287645_000018_000000 two thousand dollars REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living on the York Turnpike, eight miles from Baltimore city, on sunday april eleventh, my negro man, JACOB, aged twenty years: five feet ten inches high; chestnut color; spare made; good features.
8463_287645_000024_000003 I was afraid of being overtaken on the way." He fled from near Baltimore, where he left brothers and other relatives in chains.
8463_287645_000018_000001 I will give fifty dollars reward if taken in Baltimore city or county, and two hundred dollars if taken out of the State and secured in jail so that I get him again.
8463_287645_000023_000001 For instance, Jacob Taylor was noticed on the record book as being twenty three years of age, and the name of his master was entered as "William Pollit;" but as Jacob had never been allowed to learn to read, he might have failed in giving a correct pronunciation of the name.
8463_287645_000006_000001 It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.
8463_287645_000001_000000 JULIUS SMITH, WIFE MARY, AND BOY james, HENRY AND EDWARD SMITH, AND JACK CHRISTY.
8463_287645_000012_000000 john Wesley was thirty two years of age, of a lively turn, pleasant countenance, dark color, and ordinary size.
8463_287645_000005_000000 Julius had been kept in the dark in Maryland, but on free soil, the light rushed in upon his astonished vision to a degree almost bewildering.
8463_287645_000003_000001 Although a young man, of but twenty five, he weighed two hundred and twenty five pounds; he was tall and well formed from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.
8463_287645_000008_000000 Of this party, Edward, a boy of seventeen, called forth much sympathy; he too was claimed by Hollan.
8463_287645_000012_000003 A few years back one of their slaves, a coachman, was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death, in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards."
8463_287645_000022_000001 j b Parlett's advertisement, gave his views of the man who had enslaved him.
8463_287645_000005_000002 In his review allusion was made not only to his master, but also to his mistress, in which he said that she was "a quarrelsome and crabbed woman, middling stout." In order to show a reason why he left as he did, he stated that "there had been a fuss two or three times" previous to the escape, and it had been rumored "that somebody would have to be sold soon."
8463_287645_000011_000000 The revelations made by these passengers were painful to listen to, and would not have been credited if any room had existed for doubt.
8463_287645_000009_000000 ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, eighteen fifty eight.
8463_287645_000002_000001 The treatment that had been meted out to them was about as tolerant as Slavery could well afford; and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that they had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a diet.
8463_287645_000002_000000 While this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted much sympathy, still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit, or very hard reports to make relative to their bondage.
8463_287645_000007_000002 From the manner in which he expressed himself, with regard to Robert Hollan, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he; his enthralment while under Hollan will hardly ever be forgotten.
8463_287645_000024_000001 I always had it in my mind to leave, but I was 'jubus', (dubious?) of starting.
8463_287645_000005_000003 This was what did the mischief so far as the "running away" was concerned.
8463_287645_000020_000001 j b PARLETT.
8463_287645_000030_000001 He hated everything like Slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made five attempts to escape.
8463_287645_000005_000004 Julius' color was nearly jet black, and his speech was very good considering his lack of book learning; his bearing was entirely self possessed and commendable.
8463_287645_000015_000001 Besides they were members of the Presbyterian Church, and john thought that they were very willing that people should believe that they were great saints.
8463_287645_000014_000000 These were specimens of the inner workings of the peculiar institution. john, however, had not only observed Slavery from a domestic stand point, he had also watched master and mistress abroad as visitors and guests in other people's houses, noticed not only how they treated white people, but also how they treated black people.
8463_287645_000003_000000 Julius, who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him, was a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions.
8463_287645_000007_000000 Henry was about twenty three years of age, of an active turn, brown skin, and had given the question of freedom his most serious attention, as his actions proved.
8463_287645_000005_000001 That his master was a man of "means and pretty high standing"--Julius thought was not much to his credit since they were obtained from unpaid labor.
1221_135766_000027_000002 "It is thou that must tell me!"
1221_135766_000025_000001 "I have no Heavenly Father!"
1221_135766_000026_000005 Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?"
1221_135766_000015_000000 "Child, what art thou?" cried the mother.
1221_135766_000026_000000 "Hush, Pearl, hush!
1221_135767_000019_000001 Look!
1221_135767_000019_000002 Look!"
3570_5696_000006_000005 The ignominy which attaches to useful effort also entered upon a less acute phase with the disappearance of compulsory labor; and the instinct of workmanship then came to assert itself with more persistence and consistency.
3570_5696_000002_000005 From that point onward, consumption has gained ground, until, at present, it unquestionably holds the primacy, though it is still far from absorbing the entire margin of production above the subsistence minimum.
3570_5696_000005_000004 But the fact that it may under stress of circumstances eventuate in inanities no more disproves the presence of the instinct than the reality of the brooding instinct is disproved by inducing a hen to sit on a nestful of china eggs.
3570_5696_000008_000001 Instead of simply passing her time in visible idleness, as in the best days of the patriarchal regime, the housewife of the advanced peaceable stage applies herself assiduously to household cares.
3570_5696_000004_000007 It is only less promptly and with less constraining force that it reaches such substantial violations of its requirements as are appreciated only upon reflection.
3570_5696_000002_000000 But there are other standards of repute and other, more or less imperative, canons of conduct, besides wealth and its manifestation, and some of these come in to accentuate or to qualify the broad, fundamental canon of conspicuous waste.
3570_5696_000004_000002 It disposes them to deprecate waste of substance or effort.
3570_5696_000008_000004 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.
3570_5696_000005_000002 All extraneous considerations apart, those persons (adult) are but a vanishing minority today who harbor no inclination to the accomplishment of some end, or who are not impelled of their own motion to shape some object or fact or relation for human use.
3570_5696_000002_000001 Under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising, we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset.
3570_5696_000008_000006 A standard of life would still be possible which should admit of invidious comparison in other respects than that of opulence; as, for instance, a comparison in various directions in the manifestation of moral, physical, intellectual, or aesthetic force.
3570_5696_000003_000000 The early ascendency of leisure as a means of reputability is traceable to the archaic distinction between noble and ignoble employments. Leisure is honorable and becomes imperative partly because it shows exemption from ignoble labor.
3570_5696_000011_000010 Consumable goods, and even productive goods, generally show the two elements in combination, as constituents of their utility; although, in a general way, the element of waste tends to predominate in articles of consumption, while the contrary is true of articles designed for productive use.
3570_5696_000010_000003 In order to meet with unqualified approval, any economic fact must approve itself under the test of impersonal usefulness-usefulness as seen from the point of view of the generically human.
3570_5696_000003_000003 This extreme inhibition of industry is avoided because slave labor, working under a compulsion more vigorous than that of reputability, is forced to turn out a product in excess of the subsistence minimum of the working class.
3570_5696_000011_000005 The test to which all expenditure must be brought in an attempt to decide that point is the question whether it serves directly to enhance human life on the whole whether it furthers the life process taken impersonally.
3570_5696_000002_000004 Leisure held the first place at the start, and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency, during the quasi peaceable culture.
3570_5696_000003_000002 Indeed, so effective is it in the relatively small and stable human environment to which the individual is exposed at that cultural stage, that, with the aid of the archaic tradition which deprecates all productive labor, it gives rise to a large impecunious leisure class, and it even tends to limit the production of the community's industry to the subsistence minimum.
3570_5696_000003_000001 The archaic differentiation into noble and ignoble classes is based on an invidious distinction between employments as honorific or debasing; and this traditional distinction grows into an imperative canon of decency during the early quasi peaceable stage. Its ascendency is furthered by the fact that leisure is still fully as effective an evidence of wealth as consumption.
3570_5696_000002_000002 Leisure might then be expected gradually to yield ground and tend to obsolescence as the economic development goes forward, and the community increases in size; while the conspicuous consumption of goods should gradually gain in importance, both absolutely and relatively, until it had absorbed all the available product, leaving nothing over beyond a bare livelihood.
3570_5696_000007_000004 A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe.
3570_5696_000010_000001 This common sense implication is itself an outcropping of the instinct of workmanship.
3570_5696_000011_000003 As items which sometimes fall under this head, and are therefore available as illustrations of the manner in which this principle applies, may be cited carpets and tapestries, silver table service, waiter's services, silk hats, starched linen, many articles of jewelry and of dress.
3570_5696_000006_000000 This latter day uneasy reaching out for some form of purposeful activity that shall at the same time not be indecorously productive of either individual or collective gain marks a difference of attitude between the modern leisure class and that of the quasi peaceable stage.
3570_5696_000008_000000 In the narrower sphere of vicarious leisure a similar change has gone forward.
3570_5696_000003_000004 The subsequent relative decline in the use of conspicuous leisure as a basis of repute is due partly to an increasing relative effectiveness of consumption as an evidence of wealth; but in part it is traceable to another force, alien, and in some degree antagonistic, to the usage of conspicuous waste.
3570_5696_000011_000006 For this is the basis of award of the instinct of workmanship, and that instinct is the court of final appeal in any question of economic truth or adequacy.
3570_5696_000002_000003 But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme.
3570_5696_000009_000000 The use of the term "waste" is in one respect an unfortunate one.
3570_5696_000006_000004 When the community developed into a peaceful industrial organization, and when fuller occupation of the land had reduced the opportunities for the hunt to an inconsiderable residue, the pressure of energy seeking purposeful employment was left to find an outlet in some other direction.
3570_5696_000008_000002 The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
3570_5696_000004_000004 So that however wasteful a given expenditure may be in reality, it must at least have some colorable excuse in the way of an ostensible purpose.
3570_5696_000004_000003 The instinct of workmanship is present in all men, and asserts itself even under very adverse circumstances.
3570_5696_000004_000001 Other circumstances permitting, that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.
3570_5696_000011_000007 It is a question as to the award rendered by a dispassionate common sense.
3570_5696_000007_000002 But that canon of reputability which discountenances all employment that is of the nature of productive effort is still at hand, and will permit nothing beyond the most transient vogue to any employment that is substantially useful or productive.
3570_5696_000009_000008 The use of the word "waste" as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
3570_5696_000004_000006 In so far as it comes into conflict with the law of conspicuous waste, the instinct of workmanship expresses itself not so much in insistence on substantial usefulness as in an abiding sense of the odiousness and aesthetic impossibility of what is obviously futile. Being of the nature of an instinctive affection, its guidance touches chiefly and immediately the obvious and apparent violations of its requirements.
3570_5696_000007_000006 And along with the make believe of purposeful employment, and woven inextricably into its texture, there is commonly, if not invariably, a more or less appreciable element of purposeful effort directed to some serious end.
3570_5696_000009_000005 If he chooses it, that disposes of the question of its relative utility to him, as compared with other forms of consumption that would not be deprecated on account of their wastefulness.
3570_5696_000009_000007 As seen from the point of view of the individual consumer, the question of wastefulness does not arise within the scope of economic theory proper.
3570_5696_000004_000000 This alien factor is the instinct of workmanship.
3570_5696_000008_000003 Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
3570_5696_000008_000005 No merit would accrue from the consumption of the bare necessaries of life, except by comparison with the abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum; and no standard of expenditure could result from such a comparison, except the most prosaic and unattractive level of decency.
3570_5695_000001_000007 It is by no means an uncommon spectacle to find a man applying himself to work with the utmost assiduity, in order that his wife may in due form render for him that degree of vicarious leisure which the common sense of the time demands.
3570_5695_000001_000006 But the derivative fact the vicarious leisure and consumption rendered by the wife, and the auxiliary vicarious performance of leisure by menials remains in vogue as a conventionality which the demands of reputability will not suffer to be slighted.
3570_5695_000004_000011 The last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity.
3570_5695_000004_000013 There is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
3570_5695_000005_000004 The question is, which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
3570_5695_000007_000002 The only practicable means of impressing one's pecuniary ability on these unsympathetic observers of one's everyday life is an unremitting demonstration of ability to pay.
3570_5695_000010_000004 The inertia due to the home feeling is consequently also slight.
3570_5695_000004_000012 Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away.
3570_5695_000010_000009 Here as elsewhere prescription seizes upon the custom as soon as it gains a vogue, and incorporates it in the accredited standard of decency.
3570_5695_000001_000004 In descending the social scale in any modern industrial community, the primary fact the conspicuous leisure of the master of the household disappears at a relatively high point.
3570_5695_000008_000008 The standard of decency is higher, class for class, and this requirement of decent appearance must be lived up to on pain of losing caste.
3570_5695_000000_000002 In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
3570_5695_000005_000003 On grounds of expediency the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development.
3570_5695_000008_000004 It is not that the city population is by nature much more eager for the peculiar complacency that comes of a conspicuous consumption, nor has the rural population less regard for pecuniary decency.
3570_5695_000004_000001 It is rather that the leisure class scheme of life here comes to an expression at the second remove.
3570_5695_000002_000008 The more reputable, "presentable" portion of middle class household paraphernalia are, on the one hand, items of conspicuous consumption, and on the other hand, apparatus for putting in evidence the vicarious leisure rendered by the housewife.
3570_5695_000010_000006 The result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing; perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen.
3570_5695_000005_000001 Both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth, and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents.
3570_5695_000010_000005 At the same time the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy.
3570_5695_000002_000004 The effects are pleasing to us chiefly because we have been taught to find them pleasing.
3570_5695_000009_000005 Considered by itself simply-taken in the first degree-this added provocation to which the artisan and the urban laboring classes are exposed may not very seriously decrease the amount of savings; but in its cumulative action, through raising the standard of decent expenditure, its deterrent effect on the tendency to save cannot but be very great.
3570_5695_000000_000004 But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
3570_5695_000010_000002 The state of the case for the men who work in the composition and press rooms of the common run of printing houses may be summed up as follows. Skill acquired in any printing house or any city is easily turned to account in almost any other house or city; that is to say, the inertia due to special training is slight.
3570_5695_000005_000005 Usage has answered this question in different ways under different circumstances.
3570_5695_000002_000003 Not that the results of her attention to household matters, of a decorative and mundificatory character, are not pleasing to the sense of men trained in middle class proprieties; but the taste to which these effects of household adornment and tidiness appeal is a taste which has been formed under the selective guidance of a canon of propriety that demands just these evidences of wasted effort.
3570_5695_000006_000004 The means of communication and the mobility of the population now expose the individual to the observation of many persons who have no other means of judging of his reputability than the display of goods (and perhaps of breeding) which he is able to make while he is under their direct observation.
3570_5695_000002_000001 It almost invariably occurs disguised under some form of work or household duties or social amenities, which prove on analysis to serve little or no ulterior end beyond showing that she does not occupy herself with anything that is gainful or that is of substantial use.
3570_5695_000010_000008 The human proclivity to ostentation, reenforced by sentiments of good fellowship, leads them to spend freely in those directions which will best serve these needs.
3570_5695_000004_000003 The observance of these standards, in some degree of approximation, becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale.
3570_5695_000008_000007 The requirement of conformity to this higher conventional standard becomes mandatory.
3570_5695_000007_000001 The exigencies of the modern industrial system frequently place individuals and households in juxtaposition between whom there is little contact in any other sense than that of juxtaposition. One's neighbors, mechanically speaking, often are socially not one's neighbors, or even acquaintances; and still their transient good opinion has a high degree of utility.
3570_5695_000009_000002 These home comforts and the leisure indulged in-where the indulgence is found-are of course also in great part to be classed as items of conspicuous consumption; and much the same is to be said of the savings.
3570_5695_000004_000010 No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption.
3570_5695_000007_000004 In order to impress these transient observers, and to retain one's self complacency under their observation, the signature of one's pecuniary strength should be written in characters which he who runs may read.
3570_5695_000008_000002 The result is that, in order to keep up a decent appearance, the former habitually live hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter.
3570_5695_000000_000000 With the disappearance of servitude, the number of vicarious consumers attached to any one gentleman tends, on the whole, to decrease.
3570_5695_000004_000006 The basis on which good repute in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is pecuniary strength; and the means of showing pecuniary strength, and so of gaining or retaining a good name, are leisure and a conspicuous consumption of goods.
3570_5695_000005_000002 The choice between them is a question of advertising expediency simply, except so far as it may be affected by other standards of propriety, springing from a different source.
3570_5695_000002_000006 Pretty much all that is here insisted on is that, as regards these amenities of life, the housewife's efforts are under the guidance of traditions that have been shaped by the law of conspicuously wasteful expenditure of time and substance.
3570_5695_000004_000009 The man of the household also can do something in this direction, and indeed, he commonly does; but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence-along the margin of the slums-the man, and presently also the children, virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances, and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency.
3570_5695_000005_000000 From the foregoing survey of the growth of conspicuous leisure and consumption, it appears that the utility of both alike for the purposes of reputability lies in the element of waste that is common to both. In the one case it is a waste of time and effort, in the other it is a waste of goods.
3570_5695_000004_000002 The leisure class stands at the head of the social structure in point of reputability; and its manner of life and its standards of worth therefore afford the norm of reputability for the community.
3570_5695_000010_000007 These men are constantly thrown in contact with new groups of acquaintances, with whom the relations established are transient or ephemeral, but whose good opinion is valued none the less for the time being.
3570_5695_000002_000007 If beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort.
3570_5695_000001_000002 Through force of circumstances it has fallen into disuse.
3570_5695_000008_000003 So it comes, for instance, that the American farmer and his wife and daughters are notoriously less modish in their dress, as well as less urbane in their manners, than the city artisan's family with an equal income.
3570_5695_000002_000005 There goes into these domestic duties much solicitude for a proper combination of form and color, and for other ends that are to be classed as aesthetic in the proper sense of the term; and it is not denied that effects having some substantial aesthetic value are sometimes attained.
3570_5695_000010_000001 The peculiar habits of the class in this respect are commonly set down to some kind of an ill defined moral deficiency with which this class is credited, or to a morally deleterious influence which their occupation is supposed to exert, in some unascertainable way, upon the men employed in it.
3570_5695_000009_000004 Among the latter, everybody's affairs, especially everybody's pecuniary status, are known to everybody else.
3570_5695_000006_000001 Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
3570_5695_000004_000008 Lower still, where any degree of leisure, even ostensible, has become impracticable for the wife, the conspicuous consumption of goods remains and is carried on by the wife and children.
3570_5695_000006_000003 This is especially true during the later, peaceable economic stage.
3570_5695_000007_000005 It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.
3570_5695_000001_000005 The head of the middle class household has been reduced by economic circumstances to turn his hand to gaining a livelihood by occupations which often partake largely of the character of industry, as in the case of the ordinary business man of today.
3570_5695_000004_000000 This vicarious consumption practiced by the household of the middle and lower classes can not be counted as a direct expression of the leisure class scheme of life, since the household of this pecuniary grade does not belong within the leisure class.
3570_5695_000009_000000 Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.
3570_5695_000009_000001 Among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of Pecuniary repute.
3570_5695_000008_000005 But the provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its transient effectiveness, is more decided in the city.
3570_5695_000001_000001 It is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the part of the head of the household.
3570_5695_000001_000000 And here occurs a curious inversion.
3570_5695_000008_000006 This method is therefore more readily resorted to, and in the struggle to outdo one another the city population push their normal standard of conspicuous consumption to a higher point, with the result that a relatively greater expenditure in this direction is required to indicate a given degree of pecuniary decency in the city.
3570_5695_000001_000003 But the middle class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure, for the good name of the household and its master.
3570_5695_000008_000000 It is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute, as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency, is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.
3570_5695_000002_000000 The leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is, of course, not a simple manifestation of idleness or indolence.
3570_5695_000007_000003 In the modern community there is also a more frequent attendance at large gatherings of people to whom one's everyday life is unknown; in such places as churches, theaters, ballrooms, hotels, parks, shops, and the like.
3570_5694_000013_000006 They become his courtiers or retainers, servants; and being fed and countenanced by their patron they are indices of his rank and vicarious consumer of his superfluous wealth.
3570_5694_000010_000008 High bred manners and ways of living are items of conformity to the norm of conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption.
3570_5694_000012_000001 The custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion; these motives are also present in the later development, but they do not continue to be the sole motives.
3570_5694_000010_000005 Closely related to the requirement that the gentleman must consume freely and of the right kind of goods, there is the requirement that he must know how to consume them in a seemly manner.
3570_5694_000004_000000 In what has been said of the evolution of the vicarious leisure class and its differentiation from the general body of the working classes, reference has been made to a further division of labour,--that between the different servant classes.
3570_5694_000013_000007 Many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right; so that some of them are scarcely at all, others only partially, to be rated as vicarious consumers.
3570_5694_000013_000001 This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.
3570_5694_000014_000023 This antipathy asserts itself even in the case of the liveries or uniforms which some corporations prescribe as the distinctive dress of their employees.
3570_5694_000008_000012 It has served as the norm to which consumption has tended to conform, and any appreciable departure from it is to be regarded as an aberrant form, sure to be eliminated sooner or later in the further course of development.
3570_5694_000011_000000 Conspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of reputability to the gentleman of leisure.
3570_5694_000005_000001 The beginning of a differentiation in consumption even antedates the appearance of anything that can fairly be called pecuniary strength. It is traceable back to the initial phase of predatory culture, and there is even a suggestion that an incipient differentiation in this respect lies back of the beginnings of the predatory life.
3570_5694_000009_000001 He consumes freely and of the best, in food, drink, narcotics, shelter, services, ornaments, apparel, weapons and accoutrements, amusements, amulets, and idols or divinities. In the process of gradual amelioration which takes place in the articles of his consumption, the motive principle and proximate aim of innovation is no doubt the higher efficiency of the improved and more elaborate products for personal comfort and well-being.
3570_5694_000008_000007 With many qualifications-with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened-the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
3570_5694_000007_000006 It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for "noble" or "gentle".
3570_5694_000014_000007 The services performed by them are likewise divisible into noble and ignoble.
3570_5694_000006_000007 In the nature of things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
3570_5694_000008_000002 In a sense which has been greatly qualified in scope and rigour, but which has by no means lost its meaning even yet, this tradition says that the woman, being a chattel, should consume only what is necessary to her sustenance,--except so far as her further consumption contributes to the comfort or the good repute of her master.
3570_5694_000011_000002 The aid of friends and competitors is therefore brought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments.
3570_5694_000011_000005 The competitor with whom the entertainer wishes to institute a comparison is, by this method, made to serve as a means to the end.
3570_5694_000014_000021 The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.
3570_5694_000008_000009 During the earlier stages of economic development, consumption of goods without stint, especially consumption of the better grades of goods,--ideally all consumption in excess of the subsistence minimum,--pertains normally to the leisure class.
3570_5694_000005_000002 This most primitive differentiation in the consumption of goods is like the later differentiation with which we are all so intimately familiar, in that it is largely of a ceremonial character, but unlike the latter it does not rest on a difference in accumulated wealth.
3570_5694_000010_000001 He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male,--the man of strength, resource, and intrepidity.
3570_5694_000007_000009 This invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today.
3570_5694_000005_000003 The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.
3570_5694_000010_000007 Hence arise good manners in the way pointed out in an earlier chapter.
3570_5694_000008_000004 Any such consumption by others can take place only on a basis of sufferance.
3570_5694_000009_000002 But that does not remain the sole purpose of their consumption.
3570_5694_000014_000008 Of course the distinction is not observed with strict consistency in practice; the less debasing of the base services and the less honorific of the noble functions are not infrequently merged in the same person.
3570_5694_000011_000006 He consumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is witness to the consumption of that excess of good things which his host is unable to dispose of single handed, and he is also made to witness his host's facility in etiquette.
3570_5694_000013_000000 As wealth accumulates, the leisure class develops further in function and structure, and there arises a differentiation within the class. There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.
3570_5694_000007_000010 Where the example set by the leisure class retains its imperative force in the regulation of the conventionalities, it is observable that the women still in great measure practise the same traditional continence with regard to stimulants.
3570_5694_000010_000004 This cultivation of aesthetic faculty requires time and application, and the demands made upon the gentleman in this direction therefore tend to change his life of leisure into a more or less arduous application to the business of learning how to live a life of ostensible leisure in a becoming way.
3570_5694_000008_000011 But during the earlier quasi peaceable stage, when so many of the traditions through which the institution of a leisure class has affected the economic life of later times were taking form and consistency, this principle has had the force of a conventional law.
3570_5694_000014_000012 On the other hand, those employments which properly fall to the industrious class are ignoble; such as handicraft or other productive labor, menial services and the like.
3570_5694_000006_000005 With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character; but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained, whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality, the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
3570_5694_000014_000019 In a heightened degree, therefore, the livery comes to be a badge of servitude, or rather servility.
3570_5694_000010_000003 He becomes a connoisseur in creditable viands of various degrees of merit, in manly beverages and trinkets, in seemly apparel and architecture, in weapons, games, dancers, and the narcotics.
3570_5694_000011_000003 Presents and feasts had probably another origin than that of naive ostentation, but they required their utility for this purpose very early, and they have retained that character to the present; so that their utility in this respect has now long been the substantial ground on which these usages rest.
3570_5694_000009_000003 The canon of reputability is at hand and seizes upon such innovations as are, according to its standard, fit to survive.
3570_5694_000013_000008 So many of them, however, as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification.
3570_5694_000014_000015 Whenever, as in these cases, the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting, it easily acquires a reflected honorific character.
3570_5694_000005_000000 But already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady, specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system.
3570_5694_000012_000003 But the economic effect of these social amenities is not therefore lessened, either in the vicarious consumption of goods or in the exhibition of difficult and costly achievements in etiquette.
3570_5694_000005_000004 It is an adaption to a new end, by a selective process, of a distinction previously existing and well established in men's habits of thought.
3570_5694_000007_000004 Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific, as being a mark, at the second remove, of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
3570_5694_000008_000010 This restriction tends to disappear, at least formally, after the later peaceable stage has been reached, with private ownership of goods and an industrial system based on wage labour or on the petty household economy.
3570_5694_000007_000001 If these articles of consumption are costly, they are felt to be noble and honorific.
3570_5694_000013_000004 Those who stand near the higher and the highest grades of the wealthy leisure class, in point of birth, or in point of wealth, or both, outrank the remoter born and the pecuniarily weaker.
3570_5694_000008_000008 The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule; but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.
3570_5694_000014_000014 The two offices last named suggest a principle of some general bearing.
3570_5694_000006_000006 When the quasi peaceable stage of industry is reached, with its fundamental institution of chattel slavery, the general principle, more or less rigorously applied, is that the base, industrious class should consume only what may be necessary to their subsistence.
3570_5694_000014_000004 As the group whose good esteem is to be secured in this way grows larger, more patent means are required to indicate the imputation of merit for the leisure performed, and to this end uniforms, badges, and liveries come into vogue.
3570_5694_000007_000005 Infirmities induced by over indulgence are among some peoples freely recognised as manly attributes.
3570_5694_000014_000013 But a base service performed for a person of very high degree may become a very honorific office; as for instance the office of a Maid of Honor or of a Lady in Waiting to the Queen, or the King's Master of the Horse or his Keeper of the Hounds.
3570_5694_000010_000002 In order to avoid stultification he must also cultivate his tastes, for it now becomes incumbent on him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and the ignoble in consumable goods.
3570_5694_000013_000003 Hence results a class of impecunious gentlemen of leisure, incidentally referred to already. These half caste gentlemen of leisure fall into a system of hierarchical gradations.
3570_5694_000009_000004 Since the consumption of these more excellent goods is an evidence of wealth, it becomes honorific; and conversely, the failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit.
3570_5694_000007_000003 From archaic times down through all the length of the patriarchal regime it has been the office of the women to prepare and administer these luxuries, and it has been the perquisite of the men of gentle birth and breeding to consume them.
3570_5694_000006_000004 The consumption of choice articles of food, and frequently also of rare articles of adornment, becomes tabu to the women and children; and if there is a base (servile) class of men, the tabu holds also for them.
3570_5694_000008_000000 This characterisation of the greater continence in the use of stimulants practised by the women of the reputable classes may seem an excessive refinement of logic at the expense of common sense.
3570_5694_000011_000001 As wealth accumulates on his hands, his own unaided effort will not avail to sufficiently put his opulence in evidence by this method.
3570_5694_000014_000022 We are yet so little removed from a state of effective slavery as still to be fully sensitive to the sting of any imputation of servility.
3570_5694_000011_000004 Costly entertainments, such as the potlatch or the ball, are peculiarly adapted to serve this end.
3570_5694_000010_000000 This growth of punctilious discrimination as to qualitative excellence in eating, drinking, etc presently affects not only the manner of life, but also the training and intellectual activity of the gentleman of leisure.
3570_5694_000007_000002 Therefore the base classes, primarily the women, practice an enforced continence with respect to these stimulants, except in countries where they are obtainable at a very low cost.
3570_5694_000014_000009 But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.
3570_5694_000006_000008 Under the tabu, certain victuals, and more particularly certain beverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
3570_5694_000012_000002 The latter day leisure class festivities and entertainments may continue in some slight degree to serve the religious need and in a higher degree the needs of recreation and conviviality, but they also serve an invidious purpose; and they serve it none the less effectually for having a colorable non invidious ground in these more avowable motives.
3570_5694_000010_000006 His life of leisure must be conducted in due form.
3570_5694_000014_000018 Vicarious consumption by dependents bearing the insignia of their patron or master narrows down to a corps of liveried menials.
3570_5694_000006_000002 Such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work; it is a means to their continued labour, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life.
3570_5694_000014_000006 The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile, or the noble and the ignoble.
3570_5694_000008_000001 But facts within easy reach of any one who cares to know them go to say that the greater abstinence of women is in some part due to an imperative conventionality; and this conventionality is, in a general way, strongest where the patriarchal tradition-the tradition that the woman is a chattel-has retained its hold in greatest vigour.
3570_5694_000014_000002 As regards feasts and largesses this is obvious enough, and the imputation of repute to the host or patron here takes place immediately, on the ground of common notoriety.
3570_5694_000007_000008 The same invidious distinction adds force to the current disapproval of any indulgence of this kind on the part of women, minors, and inferiors.
3570_5694_000006_000000 In the earlier phases of the predatory culture the only economic differentiation is a broad distinction between an honourable superior class made up of the able bodied men on the one side, and a base inferior class of labouring women on the other.
3570_5694_000014_000005 The wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence, and may even be said to be a mark of servitude, real or ostensible.
3570_5694_000008_000003 The consumption of luxuries, in the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master.
1995_1837_000011_000002 Perhaps-if the water had but drained from the cotton!--it was so strong and tall! But, p shaw!
1995_1837_000019_000000 The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
1995_1837_000024_000001 The chair was empty; but he knew.
1995_1837_000019_000002 So the world was happy, and the face of the black belt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming foam of the cotton.
1995_1837_000026_000002 He came down to her slowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, threading his way amid the Fleece.
1995_1837_000012_000006 The lagoon was dry.
1995_1837_000023_000000 Then suddenly a panic seized her.
1995_1837_000016_000001 The earth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on; the mud splashed and sunlight glistened; he saw long snakes slithering across his path and fear struck beasts fleeing before his coming.
1995_1837_000010_000000 Child?
1995_1837_000012_000005 Then he looked down.
1995_1837_000012_000000 Perhaps she, too, might be there, waiting, weeping.
1995_1837_000012_000008 A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place, and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green, thick, tall, wet, and willowy.
1995_1837_000022_000003 Bles did not know yet that she was down; but soon he would come searching, for he came each hour, and she pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of her heart and the bursting wonder of her love.
1995_1837_000012_000001 He started at the thought.
1995_1837_000024_000000 He heard that she was down stairs and ran to meet her with beating heart.
1995_1837_000021_000002 The Sun, the Swamp? Then finding all well, she closed her eyes and slept.
1995_1837_000010_000005 To her all things meant something-nothing was aimless, nothing merely happened.
1995_1837_000025_000000 She stood on the island, ethereal, splendid, like some tall, dark, and gorgeous flower of the storied East.
1995_1837_000012_000004 He splashed and stamped along, farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing, and put foot upon the tree bridge.
1995_1837_000013_000001 He gazed about, perplexed, astonished.
1995_1837_000021_000003 After some days they let her sit by the window, and she saw Bles pass, but drew back timidly when he looked; and he saw only the flutter of her gown, and waved.
1995_1837_000011_000001 Bles rushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute.
1995_1837_000026_000003 She did not move, but lifted both her dark hands, white with cotton; and then, as he came, casting it suddenly to the winds, in tears and laughter she swayed and dropped quivering in his arms.
1995_1837_000017_000000 "Miss Smith-!" he gasped, and then-darkness.
1995_1837_000013_000000 The swamp, the eternal swamp, had been drained in its deepest fastness; but, how?--how?
1995_1837_000023_000003 The dark mystery of the Swamp swept over her; the place was hers.
1995_1837_000011_000003 Where was the use of imagining?
1995_1837_000014_000001 Here lay the reading of the riddle: with infinite work and pain, some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek, into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way, thus allowing it to empty directly.
1995_1837_000014_000000 He skirted the island slowly, stopping near Zora's oak.
1995_1837_000020_000000 Up in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed.
1995_1837_000015_000003 There she lay-wet, bedraggled, motionless, gray pallid beneath her dark drawn skin, her burning eyes searching restlessly for some lost thing, her lips a moaning.
1995_1837_000021_000001 The Silver Fleece, how was it?
1995_1837_000012_000002 He hurried forth sadly.
1995_1837_000019_000001 The cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain; but the sun had saved the best, and the price had soared.
1995_1837_000020_000001 The net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her; she had struggled in dumb, speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life, with gnarled and creeping fingers; but now at last, weakly, she opened her eyes and questioned.
1995_1837_000024_000003 Yet it was far, and he feared, and ran with startled eyes.
1995_1837_000013_000002 What a field of cotton! what a marvellous field!
1995_1837_000012_000003 The rain drops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight.
1995_1837_000023_000006 A great white foam was spread upon its brown and green; the whole field was waving and shivering in the sunlight.
1995_1836_000003_000003 The price he had paid was high: he was to represent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures were already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combine's legal department.
1995_1836_000004_000002 He had tried independence and philanthropy and failed.
1995_1836_000037_000000 "Yes, indeed," Cresswell agreed.
1995_1836_000028_000000 mrs Grey wanted particulars.
1995_1836_000041_000000 "I thought the only excuse for fighting was a great Right; if Right is on neither side or simultaneously on both, then War is not only Hell but Damnation."
1995_1836_000004_000007 There was young Cresswell.
1995_1836_000009_000000 mr Cresswell inclined his head courteously.
1995_1836_000004_000005 They were gentlemen.
1995_1836_000025_000000 mrs Grey was gratified and murmured something of Miss Smith's "sacrifice."
1995_1836_000007_000000 mrs Grey's chef was high priced and efficient, and her butler was the envy of many; consequently, she knew the dinner would be good.
1995_1836_000004_000006 Why should he pose as better than his fellows?
1995_1836_000003_000004 Among others was one relating to child labor, another that would effect certain changes in the tariff, and a proposed law providing for a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the customary-the last constituting a particularly clever artifice which, under the guise of convenience in handling, would necessitate the installation of entirely new gin and compress machinery, to be supplied, of course, by the trust.
1995_1836_000007_000002 It was a most agreeable couple of hours; all save perhaps mr Smith unbent, the Englishman especially, and the Vanderpools were most gracious; but if the general pleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to mr Harry Cresswell.
1995_1836_000022_000000 Then Mary Taylor, whose conscience was uncomfortable, said:
1995_1836_000004_000001 After all why should he care?
1995_1836_000035_000001 mrs Grey wanted to hear the incident, but the young man was politely reluctant.
1995_1836_000011_000000 They all glanced at Miss Cresswell, who lay softly back in her chair like a white lily, gleaming and bejewelled, her pale face flushing under the scrutiny; mrs Grey was horrified.
1995_1836_000018_000000 "I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity." The Englishman here heartily seconded him.
1995_1836_000030_000000 "But you mean to say you can't even advise her?"
1995_1836_000008_000000 "Why, I thought," said mrs Grey, "that you Southerners rather disapproved-or at least-"
1995_1836_000016_000000 mr Cresswell explained.
1995_1836_000003_000002 At last the Cotton Combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
1995_1836_000045_000000 Very soon after dinner Charles Smith excused himself.
1995_1836_000036_000000 "Fortunately," said mr Vanderpool, "Northerners and Southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters."
1995_1836_000016_000001 No, of course there was no immediate danger; but when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station, filled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions, it meant terrible danger to Southern white women.
1995_1836_000004_000008 Did his aristocratic air prevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the influence of his father and the whole Farmer's League to the new project?
1995_1836_000031_000000 "Oh, no; we can.
1995_1836_000004_000012 There was just the touch of early autumn chill in the air without, that made both the fire and the table with its soft linen, gold and silver plate, and twinkling glasses a warming, satisfying sight.
1995_1836_000023_000000 "But, mr Cresswell, you surely believe in schools like Miss Smith's?"
1995_1836_000042_000000 mrs Grey looked shocked and mrs Vanderpool smiled.
1995_1836_000004_000003 Why should he not be as other men?
1995_1836_000026_000000 "Positively heroic," added Cresswell, avoiding his sister's eyes.
1995_1836_000019_000000 "But," Cresswell added significantly, "capacity differs enormously between races."
1995_1836_000004_000010 The door opened softly.
1995_1836_000013_000000 mr Cresswell sipped his wine slowly.
1995_1836_000007_000001 To her intense satisfaction, it was far more than this.
1995_1836_000005_000001 She was not herself a notably intelligent woman; she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others.
1995_1836_000015_000000 "Really, now, you do not mean to say that there is a danger of-of amalgamation, do you?" he sang.
1995_1836_000028_000001 "What did you disagree about?" she asked bluntly.
1995_1826_000035_000000 The word was often on Miss Taylor's lips, and she recognized it.
1995_1826_000016_000004 She groped for new ways to teach colored brains and marshal colored thoughts and the result was puzzling both to teacher and student.
1995_1826_000008_000000 "But, john, there's no society-just elementary work-"
1995_1826_000016_000008 She appealed to Miss Taylor's ruddier and daintier vision but dimly and distantly as some memory of the past.
1995_1826_000027_000000 "Goobers," answered the smaller boy.
1995_1826_000010_000002 Some others, too; big cotton county."
1995_1826_000012_000003 Give 'em your Greek-and study Cotton.
1995_1826_000010_000000 "Been looking up Tooms County.
1995_1826_000048_000000 He harkened.
1995_1826_000056_000001 Always before she had been veiled from these folk: who had put the veil there?
1995_1826_000018_000004 The glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her, stretching away to the Northward. She remembered that beyond this little world it stretched on and on-how far she did not know-but on and on in a great trembling sea, and the foam of its mighty waters would one time flood the ends of the earth.
1995_1826_000004_000000 Miss Mary Taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of teaching Negroes.
1995_1826_000011_000000 "You ought to know, john, if I teach Negroes I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class."
1995_1826_000029_000000 "Peanuts," Bles specified.
1995_1826_000057_000000 The longer she thought, the more bewildered she grew.
1995_1826_000037_000000 Bles was now laughing outright.
1995_1826_000056_000000 She started thinking of cotton-but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect.
1995_1826_000016_000001 But here in Alabama, brought closely and intimately in touch with these dark skinned children, their color struck her at first with a sort of terror-it seemed ominous and forbidding.
1995_1826_000005_000001 She had pictured herself earning this by teaching one or two of her "specialties" in some private school near New York or Boston, or even in a Western college.
1995_1826_000004_000003 Nevertheless, when the end of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching of children at Miss Smith's experiment in the Alabama swamps, it must be frankly confessed that Miss Taylor was disappointed.
1995_1826_000005_000003 But from the offer that came to teach Negroes-country Negroes, and little ones at that-she shrank, and, indeed, probably would have refused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother, john.
1995_1826_000036_000001 But what did I say so funny?"
1995_1826_000047_000000 "The Golden Fleece-it's the Silver Fleece!"
1995_1826_000042_000000 His eyes lighted, for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing, and a life-long companion, yet not one whose friendship had been coarsened and killed by heavy toil.
1995_1826_000031_000003 She reddened, drew herself up, and then, dropping her primness, rippled with laughter.
1995_1826_000030_000000 "Oh!" murmured Miss Taylor.
1995_1826_000026_000000 "What is planted over there?" she asked, although she really didn't care.
1995_1826_000020_000000 She glanced absently at the boys.
1995_1826_000051_000000 "No, ma'am," he said eagerly; then glancing up toward the Cresswell fields, he saw two white men watching them.
1995_1826_000012_000004 At any rate, I say go."
1995_1826_000022_000001 Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995_1826_000022_000000 "Cotton is a wonderful thing, is it not, boys?" she said rather primly. The boys touched their hats and murmured something indistinctly.
1995_1826_000013_000000 And so, howsoever reluctantly, she had gone.
1995_1826_000016_000013 So for the hundredth time she was thinking today, as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn, and then slowly down through the bottoms.
1995_1826_000038_000001 I declare!
1995_1826_000031_000000 Then came the explosion.
1995_1826_000004_000001 Not that she objected to Negroes as human beings-quite the contrary.
1995_1826_000045_000001 But it's prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst, and the cotton covers the field like foam, all misty-"
1995_1826_000046_000001 The poetry of the thing began to sing within her, awakening her unpoetic imagination, and she murmured:
1995_1826_000028_000000 "Goobers?" uncomprehendingly.
1995_1826_000051_000001 He grasped his hoe and started briskly to work.
1995_1826_000018_000000 She paused.
1995_1826_000005_000002 The South she had not thought of seriously; and yet, knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate, she was not averse to Charleston or New Orleans.
1995_1826_000039_000000 "Is that so?"
1995_1826_000016_000009 The other teachers were indistinct personalities, always very busy and very tired, and talking "school room" with their meals.
1995_1826_000030_000002 I suppose, though, it's too early for them."
1995_1826_000016_000007 Miss Smith represented the older New England of her parents-honest, inscrutable, determined, with a conscience which she worshipped, and utterly unselfish.
1995_1826_000016_000000 "What's the mere color of a human soul's skin," she had cried to a Wellesley audience and the audience had applauded with enthusiasm.
1995_1826_000006_000001 "Might learn something useful down there."
1995_1826_000012_000002 Show off.
1995_1826_000012_000000 "Nonsense!
1995_1826_000016_000010 Miss Taylor was soon starving for human companionship, for the lighter touches of life and some of its warmth and laughter.
1995_1826_000016_000011 She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995_1826_000055_000000 She began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the boy's color had quite escaped her; and what especially puzzled her was that this had not happened before.
1995_1826_000021_000001 Then her New England conscience stepped in.
1995_1826_000031_000002 And Bles-was Miss Taylor deceived?--or was he chuckling?
1995_1826_000033_000000 He looked at her with twinkling eyes.
1995_1826_000036_000000 "Of course, it isn't-I don't know anything about farming.
1995_1826_000016_000012 She felt out of the world, shut in and mentally anaemic; great as the "Negro Problem" might be as a world problem, it looked sordid and small at close range.
4507_16021_000014_000000 Where are we at this moment?
4507_16021_000034_000000 It is unintelligible in the dark.
4507_16021_000031_000001 There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
4507_16021_000025_000005 They are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang!
4507_16021_000020_000000 When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom?
4507_16021_000022_000006 It is the language of wretchedness.
4507_16021_000034_000003 Obscurity in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices.
4507_16021_000028_000003 Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts?
4507_16021_000021_000002 It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool.
4507_16021_000034_000002 It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still in crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang.
4507_16021_000037_000000 Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and the unfortunate.
4507_16021_000032_000002 Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil.
4507_16021_000037_000001 In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
4507_16021_000009_000000 CHAPTER one-ORIGIN
4507_16021_000039_000000 However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy.
4507_16021_000023_000010 The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits, "Pomona," the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms," a horse, "a courser," the white or tricolored cockade, "the rose of Bellona," the three cornered hat, "Mars' triangle,"--that classical Academician talks slang.
4507_16021_000028_000004 Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli?
4507_16021_000023_000008 A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, which used to say: "Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,"--talked slang.
4507_16021_000032_000001 Is it really the French tongue, the great human tongue?
4507_16021_000036_000004 This without reckoning in the pains of the heart.
4507_16021_000022_000003 He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity.
4507_16021_000025_000000 To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend the records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself.
4507_16021_000040_000000 When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still suffer. The day is born in tears.
4507_16021_000035_000007 Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?
4507_16021_000039_000001 People suffer in the light; excess burns.
4507_16021_000035_000001 Alas!
4507_16021_000027_000000 It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for more than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible human misery.
4507_16021_000039_000003 To burn without ceasing to fly,--therein lies the marvel of genius.
4507_16021_000030_000000 Man is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a double focus.
4507_16021_000026_000000 To this we reply in one word, only.
4507_16021_000033_000000 When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society, one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. One distinguishes questions and replies.
4507_16021_000018_000003 Slang makes one shudder!"
4507_16021_000031_000002 In this guise it becomes horrible.
4507_16021_000035_000006 The earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail.
4507_16021_000022_000005 What is slang, properly speaking?
4507_16021_000029_000004 All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface.
4507_16021_000035_000000 Let us have compassion on the chastised.
4507_16021_000038_000001 To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,--that is the object.
4507_16021_000019_000000 Who denies that?
4507_16021_000022_000000 Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
4507_16021_000013_000000 She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
4507_16021_000016_000002 Why, argot is horrible!
4507_16021_000025_000001 This service Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered, by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects.
4507_16021_000023_000002 The painter who says: "My grinder," the notary who says: "My Skip the Gutter," the hairdresser who says: "My mealyback," the cobbler who says: "My cub," talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right and the left, the sailor's port and starboard, the scene shifter's court side, and garden side, the beadle's Gospel side and Epistle side, are slang.
4507_16021_000029_000000 Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind.
4507_16021_000018_000002 Slang is odious!
4507_16021_000036_000001 Well! you are sad every day.
4507_16021_000036_000005 And so it goes on.
4507_16021_000036_000007 There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny.
4507_16021_000016_000003 It is the language of prisons, galleys, convicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!" etc, etc
4507_16021_000015_000000 What is slang?
4507_16021_000021_000001 Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang.
4507_16021_000016_000001 How! Argot!
4507_16021_000023_000007 The sugar manufacturer who says: "Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,"--this honest manufacturer talks slang.
4507_16021_000022_000004 For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result.
4507_16021_000022_000001 Since when has malady banished medicine?
4507_16021_000032_000000 One finds it difficult to recognize.
4507_16021_000023_000000 We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is one way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence, have their own slang.
4507_16021_000038_000003 To teach reading, means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.
4507_16021_000025_000004 Even dialect, let that pass!
4507_16021_000035_000002 Who are we ourselves?
4507_16021_000034_000001 It gnashes and whispers, completing the gloom with mystery.
4507_16021_000033_000002 It is slang. The words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality.
4507_16021_000036_000000 Are you what is called a happy man?
4507_16021_000024_000002 For our part, we reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and determined significance, and we restrict slang to slang.
4507_16021_000011_000000 It engenders a whole world, la pegre, for which read theft, and a hell, la pegrenne, for which read hunger.
4507_16021_000036_000006 One cloud is dispelled, another forms.
4507_16021_000025_000003 Phoenician, very good! Levantine, quite right!
4507_16021_000017_000000 We have never understood this sort of objections.
4507_16021_000035_000008 Look closely at life.
4507_16021_000024_000000 No doubt.
4507_16021_000021_000003 One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares.
4507_16021_000030_000001 Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.
4507_16021_000036_000002 Each day has its own great grief or its little care.
4507_16021_000033_000001 One perceives, without understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents, but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word.
4507_16021_000029_000002 The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and this is true reciprocally.
4507_16021_000035_000009 It is so made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.
4507_16021_000028_000005 Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre?
4507_16021_000024_000005 To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is slang.
4507_16021_000039_000002 The flame is the enemy of the wing.
4507_16021_000026_000001 Assuredly, if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study.
4507_16021_000036_000008 And you belong to that small class who are happy!
4507_16021_000019_000001 Of course it does.
4507_16021_000038_000002 That is why we cry: Education! science!
4507_16021_000036_000009 As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.
4507_16021_000020_000003 Why should one halt on the way?
4507_16021_000029_000003 They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced, and which often bring forth results.
4507_16021_000033_000003 One thinks one hears hydras talking.
4507_16021_000021_000004 One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab.
4507_16021_000029_000005 True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.
4507_16021_000025_000006 What is the use of preserving slang?
5683_32866_000019_000000 They had not walked far, when Lake suddenly said-
5683_32866_000029_000001 But Rachel at last said-
5683_32866_000006_000000 And he added something still less complimentary.
5683_32866_000021_000002 She provokes me.'
5683_32866_000047_000004 I boldly lighted my cheroot.
5683_32866_000036_000000 Miss Rachel only glanced across her mufflers on his face.
5683_32866_000045_000004 Its four posts were, like the rest of it, oak, well nigh black, fantastically turned and carved, with a great urn like capital and base, and shaped midway, like a gigantic lance handle.
5683_32866_000039_000005 Whatever you meditate, he probably anticipates it-you know best-and you will find him prepared.
5683_32866_000022_000000 'But I thought she liked Sir Harry Bracton: he's a good looking fellow; and Queen's Bracton is a very nice thing, you know.'
5683_32866_000012_000001 But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
5683_32866_000021_000001 It is quite understood. It was all, you know, old Lady Chelford's arrangement: and Dorcas is so supine, I believe she would allow herself to be given away by anyone, and to anyone, rather than be at the least trouble.
5683_32866_000047_000005 I peeped through the dense window curtain there were no shutters.
5683_32866_000002_000000 CHAPTER eleven.
5683_32866_000035_000001 I assure you, upon my honour, I've no secret.
5683_32866_000045_000008 All the furniture belonged to other times.
5683_32866_000039_000001 What I say is altogether on your own account.
5683_32866_000028_000000 'It is very happy, for her at least, they are not,' said Rachel, and a long silence ensued.
5683_32866_000047_000001 My cigar case was a resource.
5683_32866_000036_000001 There was a bright moonlight, broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves; and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features.
5683_32866_000047_000008 The sombre old trees, like gigantic hearse plumes, black and awful.
5683_32866_000024_000002 If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once. Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.'
5683_32866_000005_000001 Old women always like rascals.'
5683_32866_000004_000000 Miss Lake declined the carriage to night.
5683_32866_000021_000000 'I don't think they pretend to like one another.
5683_32866_000045_000006 I was always a lover of such antiquities, but I confess at that moment I would have vastly preferred a sprightly modern chintz and a trumpery little French bed in a corner of the Brandon Arms.
5683_32866_000020_000001 'I really don't think Wylder cares twopence about her, or she about him,' and Stanley Lake laughed gently and sleepily.
5683_32866_000048_000001 A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney, and startled me confoundedly.
5683_32866_000005_000000 'Did you see that?' said Wylder in my ear, with a chuckle; and, wagging his head, he added, rather loftily for him, 'Miss Brandon, I reckon, has taken your measure, Master Stanley, as well as i I wonder what the deuce the old dowager sees in him.
5683_32866_000031_000000 'I, Radie?' he answered quietly, 'why on earth should you think so?'
5683_32866_000025_000000 The fact is, Captain Lake, an accomplished player, made a pretty little revenue of Sir Harry's billiards, which were wild and noisy; and liking his money, thought he liked himself-a confusion not uncommon.
5683_32866_000039_000007 You were always the same, close, dark, and crooked, and wise in your own conceit.
5683_32866_000008_000000 'You seem to be very sensible, mr De Cresseron; pray tell me, frankly, what do you think of all this?'
5683_32866_000047_000009 The chapel lay full in view, where so many of the, strange and equivocal race, under whose ancient roof tree I then stood, were lying under their tombstones.
5683_32866_000029_000000 Their walk continued silent for the greater part, neither was quite satisfied with the other.
5683_32866_000016_000002 She was so unreserved, it seemed, and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous.
5683_32866_000013_000000 'I take that for granted: in the nature of things it can hardly be otherwise,' I replied, a good deal startled and perplexed by the curious audacity of her interrogatory.
5683_32866_000040_000001 Would you dislike my smoking a cigar, Radie?'
5683_32866_000044_000002 When I heard the servant's step traversing that long gallery, as it seemed to the in haste to be gone, and when all grew quite silent, I began to feel a dismal sort of sensation, and lighted the pair of wax candles which I found upon the small writing table.
5683_32866_000045_000005 Its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry.
5683_32866_000016_000000 I was vexed with myself for having managed with so little skill a conversation which, opened so oddly and frankly, might have placed me on relations so nearly confidential, with that singular and beautiful girl. I ought to have rejoiced-but we don't always see what most concerns our peace.
5683_32866_000047_000002 I was not a bit afraid of being found out.
5683_32866_000048_000000 Somehow, I had grown nervous.
5683_32866_000045_000002 The portion of it which the carpet did not cover showed it to be oak, dark and rugged.
5683_32866_000039_000006 You have given him time enough.
5683_32866_000024_000000 'Why-what has Sir Harry done?
5683_32866_000039_000002 Mark my words, you'll find him too strong for you; aye, and too deep.
5683_32866_000040_000000 'Really, Radie, you're enough to frighten a poor fellow; you won't mind a word I say, and go on predicting all manner of mischief between me and Wylder, the very nature of which I can't surmise.
5683_32866_000035_000000 'Really, Radie, you're quite mistaken.
5683_32866_000018_000000 In the meantime, Miss Lake, with her hand on her brother's arm, was walking swiftly under the trees of the back avenue towards that footpath which, through wild copse and broken clumps near the park, emerges upon the still darker road which passes along the wooded glen by the mills, and skirts the little paling of the recluse lady's garden.
5683_32866_000017_000000 By this time Lord Chelford and Wylder returned; and, disgusted rather with myself, I ruminated on my want of general ship.
5683_32866_000012_000000 'Very wise-exactly.
5683_32866_000011_000000 'There can hardly be a second opinion, Miss Brandon; I think it a very wise measure,' I replied, much surprised.
5683_32866_000047_000003 I did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney.
5683_32866_000033_000000 'Now that's impossible, Radie; for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening-except just while we were talking.'
5683_32866_000023_000000 'Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.
5683_32866_000042_000000 To my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds.
5683_32866_000012_000002 Do you really think your friend, mr Wylder, cares about me?'
5683_32866_000043_000001 It was one of many, opening upon the long gallery, which had been the scene, four generations back, of that unnatural and bloody midnight duel which had laid one scion of this ancient house in his shroud, and driven another a fugitive to the moral solitudes of a continental banishment.
5683_32866_000007_000000 I suppose the balance of attraction and repulsion was overcome by Miss Lake, much as he disliked Stanley, for Wylder followed them out with Lord Chelford, to help the young lady into her cloak and goloshes, and I found myself near Miss Brandon for the first time that evening, and much to my surprise she was first to speak, and that rather strangely.
5683_32866_000023_000001 Something may be made of Mark Wylder.
5683_32865_000015_000001 That meal passed off rather pleasantly; and when we joined the ladies in the drawing room, the good vicar's enthusiastic little wife came to meet us, in one of her honest little raptures.
5683_32865_000003_000002 I glanced round for Wylder, but he was not there.
5683_32865_000021_000001 I see-to be sure-really, Wylder, it does your taste infinite credit.'
5683_32865_000042_000000 Just to get him off this unpleasant groove with a little jolt, I said-
5683_32865_000045_000000 'I believe, Charlie,' he recommenced suddenly, 'there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours; is there?
5683_32865_000008_000002 My mother could tell us all about it-we, Brandons, Lakes; Wylders, and Chelfords.'
5683_32865_000037_000001 He's a very gentlemanlike fellow and your cousin.'
5683_32865_000034_000001 It can't be for money, or balls, or play, and he has no honest business anywhere.
5683_32865_000027_000001 Look at it, do, mr Wylder-isn't it like the ace of hearts?'
5683_32865_000010_000003 I wonder she did not smile oftener, it became her so. But her greeting to Captain Lake was more than usually haughty and frozen, and her features, I fancied, particularly proud and pale.
5683_32865_000013_000002 Her conversation was lively, and rather bold, not at all in the coarse sense, but she struck me as having formed a system of ethics and views of life, both good humoured and sarcastic, and had carried into her rustic sequestration the melancholy and precocious lore of her early London experience.
5683_32865_000052_000000 And Wylder chuckled angrily, and the small change in his pocket tinkled fiercely, as his eye glanced on the graceful captain, who was entertaining the ladies, no doubt, very agreeably in the distance.
5683_32865_000019_000001 'Is this yours, mrs Wylder?'
5683_32865_000005_000001 There was something evil and shrinking in his aspect, which I felt with a sort of chill, like the commencing fascination of a serpent.
5683_32865_000024_000000 'What are you laughing at?' asked Wylder, a little snappishly.
5683_32865_000040_000001 he'll soon be back in town, or to Brighton,' I said.
5683_32865_000001_000000 THE ACE OF HEARTS.
5683_32865_000049_000000 'Yes.'
5683_32865_000045_000003 I forget all the other good things he did; but he ended by shooting himself through the head in his bed room, and that was not the worst thing ever he did.'
5683_32865_000005_000000 And Lake turned round upon me, a little abruptly, his odd yellowish eyes, a little like those of the sea eagle, and the ghost of his smile that flickered on his singularly pale face, with a stern and insidious look, confronted me.
5683_32865_000012_000000 'Shake hands with your cousin, my dear,' said old Lady Chelford, peremptorily.
5683_32865_000022_000000 'I'm glad you like it,' says Wylder, chuckling benignantly on it, over his shoulder.
5683_32865_000034_000002 Do you know?'
5683_32865_000006_000000 The church yard meteor expired, there was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition.
5683_32865_000015_000000 At dinner Lake was easy and amusing.
5683_32865_000047_000000 'And where is he staying?'
5683_32865_000044_000003 A devil in a family now and then is not such a bad thing, when there's work for him.' (All the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following Lake.) 'They say he killed his son, a blackguard, who was found shot, with his face in the tarn in the park.
5683_32865_000029_000000 'Never mind, Wylder, it's the winning card,' said Lord Chelford, laying his hand on his shoulder.
5683_32865_000037_000000 'Why should you, though?
5683_32865_000010_000002 Whatever Lord Chelford said, Miss Brandon received it very graciously, and even with a momentary smile.
5683_32865_000036_000001 I don't know anything about him almost; but I hate him.'
5683_32865_000010_000000 So Chelford led Stanley Lake before the lady of the castle.
5683_32865_000026_000000 'Fie, Lake, there's no poetry in you,' said Lord Chelford, laughing.
5683_32865_000041_000001 That's all.'
5683_32865_000040_000000 'He's not a man for country quarters!
5683_32865_000014_000001 The captain appeared quite easy and cheerful; but Mark, I thought, notwithstanding his laughter and general jollity, was uncomfortable; and I saw him once or twice, when Stanley's eye was not upon him, glance sharply on the young man with an uneasy and not very friendly curiosity.
5683_32865_000045_000002 It's well to be distinguished in any line.
5683_32865_000008_000001 I'm bad at genealogies.
5683_32865_000014_000000 When Lord Chelford joined us, I perceived that Wylder was in the room, and saw a very cordial greeting between him and Lake.
5683_32865_000023_000001 Have you seen it, Captain Lake?' And he placed it in that gentleman's fingers, who now took his turn at the lamp, and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement.
5683_32865_000044_000005 It was not proved, only thought likely, which showed what a nice character he was; but he might have done worse.
5683_32865_000035_000001 Oh!
5683_32865_000010_000004 It seemed to me to indicate a great deal more than mere indifference-something of aversion, and nearer to a positive emotion than anything I had yet seen in that exquisitely apathetic face.
5683_32865_000046_000000 And Wylder laughed again, and began to whistle very low-not, I fancy, for want of thought, but as a sort of accompaniment thereto, for he suddenly said-
5683_32865_000050_000000 'I don't know; but I think he mentioned Larkins's house, didn't he?
5683_32865_000050_000001 I'm not quite sure.'
5683_32865_000048_000000 'Who?--Lake?'
5683_32865_000009_000000 At this moment Miss Brandon entered, with her brilliant Cousin Rachel. The blonde and the dark, it was a dazzling contrast.
5683_32865_000038_000002 I took a dislike to him at first sight long ago, and that never happened me but I was right.'
5683_32865_000044_000000 'That?
5683_32865_000017_000000 She arrested the file of gentlemen just by a large lamp, before whose effulgence she presented the subject of her eulogy-one of those costly trifles which announce the approach of Hymen, as flowers spring up before the rosy steps of May.
5683_32865_000020_000000 'Mine, indeed!' laughed poor little mrs Dorothy. 'Well, dear me, no, indeed;'--and in an earnest whisper close in his ear-'a present to Miss Brandon, and the donor is not a hundred miles away from your elbow, my lord!' and she winked slyly, and laughed, with a little nod at Wylder.
5683_32865_000043_000001 I was always afraid of him; in a long peruke, and dark red velvet coat, facing the hall door.
5683_32865_000039_000000 Wylder looked confoundedly angry and flustered, standing with his heels on the edge of the rug, his hands in his pockets, jingling some silver there, and glancing from under his red forehead sternly and unsteadily across the room.
5683_32865_000010_000001 I thought of the 'Fair Brunnisende,' with the captive knight in the hands of her seneschal before her, and I fancied he said something of having found him trespassing in her town, and brought him up for judgment.
5683_32865_000031_000000 And Wylder laughed too, more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for, and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on Lake, but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it; and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to mrs Dorothy, only remarking-
5683_32865_000035_000000 'Lake?
5683_32865_000005_000002 I often thought since that he had expected to see Wylder before him.
5683_32865_000043_000000 'By the bye, Wylder, you know the pictures here; who is the tall man, with the long pale face, and wild phosphoric eyes?
5683_32865_000004_000000 'You know Captain Lake?' said Lord Chelford, addressing me.
5683_32865_000028_000000 Wylder was laughing rather redly, with the upper part of his face very surly, I thought.
5683_32865_000034_000000 'What the d- has he come down here for?
5683_32865_000035_000002 I really can't tell; but he'll soon tire of country life.
5683_32865_000016_000000 'Now, here's a thing worth your looking at!
5683_32865_000018_000000 Well, it was pretty-French, I dare say-a little set of tablets-a toy-the cover of enamel, studded in small jewels, with a slender border of symbolic flowers, and with a heart in the centre, a mosaic of little carbuncles, rubies, and other red and crimson stones, placed with a view to light and shade.
5683_32865_000016_000002 It is such a darling little thing; and-look now-is not it magnificent?'
5683_32865_000044_000006 I suppose Miss Partridge would have had a precious lot of babbies; and who knows where the estate would have been by this time.'
5683_32865_000044_000001 Oh, I know-that's Lorne Brandon.
5683_32865_000044_000004 He was going to marry the gamekeeper's daughter, it was thought, and he and the old boy, who was for high blood, and all that, were at loggerheads about it.
5683_32865_000035_000003 I don't think he's much of a sportsman.'
5683_32865_000030_000000 Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
5683_32865_000038_000001 I don't know who's my cousin, or who isn't; nor you don't, who've been for ten years over those d-d papers; but I think he's the nastiest dog I ever met.
5683_32879_000004_000000 It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redman's Farm.
5683_32879_000030_000000 'Yes,' said Rachel.
5683_32879_000027_000000 'Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.
5683_32879_000027_000002 'Chelford had a note from mr Wylder this morning-another note-his coming delayed, and something of his having to see some person who is abroad,' continued Dorcas, after a little pause.
5683_32879_000023_000000 Dorcas's large eyes rested upon her with a grave enquiry, and then Miss Brandon looked down in silence for a while on the carpet, and was thinking a little sternly, maybe, and with a look of pain, still holding Rachel's hand, she said, with a sad sort of reproach in her tone,
5683_32879_000016_000002 I've heard of your coming here, and sending, so often.'
5683_32879_000044_000000 Dorcas, in her strange way, was moved.
5683_32879_000014_000001 There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner, which was new to Rachel, and comforting, and she returned the greeting as kindly, and felt more like her former self.
5683_32879_000029_000003 If he does not return in a day or two, Chelford, I am sure, will speak to me, and then I shall tell him my resolution.'
5683_32879_000025_000000 'No, indeed, Dorcas-never, and never will; and I think, though I have learned to fear death, I would rather die than let Stanley even suspect it.'
5683_32879_000036_000000 'I made you a voluntary promise, Dorcas, and now you will make me one.
5683_32879_000037_000000 Dorcas returned her gaze with one of haughty amazement; and Rachel said,
5683_32879_000036_000001 Of Mark Wylder I say this: his name has been for years hateful to me, and recently it has become frightful; and you will promise me simply this, that you will never ask me to speak again about him.
5683_32879_000046_000000 'Thank you, Dorcas, dear.
5683_32879_000034_000002 Yes, we sometimes conjecture right, and sometimes wrong; there are many things best not conjectured about at all-some interesting, some abominable, some that pass all comprehension: I never mean to conjecture, if I can help it, again.'
5683_32879_000049_000000 At sight of this castle or cottage in the air, Rachel lighted up.
5683_32879_000042_000002 I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me, as I have begun to love you.
5683_32879_000045_000004 I was wounded to find you had thoughts you would not trust to me; but I have made the promise, and I'll keep it; and I love you all the same.'
5683_32879_000017_000000 They sat down side by side, and Dorcas held her hand.
5683_32879_000018_000000 'Maybe, Rachel dear, you would like to drive a little?'
5683_32879_000026_000000 She spoke with a sudden energy, which partook of fear and passion, and flushed her thin cheek, and made her languid eyes flash.
5683_32879_000007_000000 The sun glimmered through the boughs behind her; her face was in shade, and its delicate chiselling was brought out in soft reflected lights; and old Tamar looked on her in a sort of wonder, her beauty seemed so celestial and splendid.
5683_32879_000008_000001 She was up and dressed, and this moment coming down, and would be very happy to see Miss Brandon, if she would step into the drawing room.
5683_32879_000029_000002 I think Lady Chelford and her son begin to think there is more in this oddly timed journey of mr Wylder's than first appeared. When I came into the parlour this morning I knew they were speaking of it.
5683_32879_000045_000002 That spirit belongs to the blood of our strange race; all our women were so.
5683_32879_000016_000000 'I shall soon be as well as I am ever likely to be-that is, quite well,' answered Rachel.
5683_32879_000034_000000 'Can I conjecture why he is gone?' murmured Rachel, still gazing with a wild kind of apathy into distance.
5683_32879_000043_000000 And she threw her arms round her cousin's neck, and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683_32879_000013_000000 She was sanguine, she was genial and companionable, and her spirits rose at the sight of a friendly face.
5683_32879_000042_000001 Remember I am neither well nor happy, and forgive what you cannot like in me.
5683_32879_000020_000000 'You have been so ill, my poor Rachel.'
5683_32879_000040_000000 'Dorcas, you are changed; have I lost your love for asking so poor a kindness?'
5683_32879_000048_000001 I'll let Brandon and abdicate.
5683_32879_000029_000001 I meant to speak to him and end all between us; and I would now write, but there is no address to his letters.
5683_32879_000045_000003 Yes, Rachel, I do love you.
5683_32879_000009_000001 I suppose she was glad and took this way of showing it; and tall, beautiful, graceful, in rustling silks, she glided into the tiny drawing room silently, and sate down softly by the window, looking out upon the flowers and the falling leaves, mottled in light and shadow.
5683_32879_000042_000003 Oh! Dorcas, darling, don't forsake me; I am very lonely here and my spirits are gone and I never needed kindness so much before.'
5683_32879_000049_000002 It was escape-flight from Gylingden-flight from Brandon-flight from Redman's Farm: they and all their hated associations would be far behind, and that awful page in her story, not torn out, indeed, but gummed down as it were, and no longer glaring and glowering in her eyes every moment of her waking life.
5683_32879_000035_000000 And the wan oracle having spoken, she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas, and she looked full in her cousin's eyes.
5683_32879_000033_000000 'I don't think, Rachel dear, you heard me?' said Dorcas.
5683_32879_000009_000000 Miss Brandon took old Tamar's hand gently and pressed it.
5683_32879_000003_000000 DORCAS BRANDON PAYS RACHEL A VISIT.
5683_32879_000046_000002 Thank you, from my heart, for your love; you will never know, perhaps, how much it is to me.'
5683_32879_000045_000000 'I like you still, Rachel; I'm sure I'll always like you.
5683_32879_000024_000000 'Rachel, dear, you have not told my secret?'
5683_32879_000045_000001 You resemble me, Rachel: you are fearless and inflexible and generous.
5683_32879_000046_000001 I like to call you cousin-kindred is so pleasant.
5683_32879_000016_000001 'You have been very kind.
5683_32879_000011_000000 So there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies, the small door opened, and Rachel entered, with her hand extended, and a pale smile of welcome.
5683_32879_000047_000000 The young queen looked on her kindly, but sadly, through her large, strange eyes, clouded with a presage of futurity, and she kissed her again, and said-
5683_32879_000050_000002 She seized it; she clung to it.
5683_32879_000015_000000 Rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise.
5683_32879_000036_000002 Be he near, or be he far, I regard his very name with horror.'
5683_32879_000031_000000 'I don't understand his absence.
5683_32879_000050_000001 It was a hope.
5683_32879_000027_000003 'You have heard, of course, of mr Wylder's absence?'
5683_32879_000012_000001 But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
5683_32879_000042_000000 'It is an antipathy-an antipathy I cannot get over, dear Dorcas; you may think it a madness, but don't blame me.
5683_32879_000014_000000 'Rachel, dear, I'm so glad to see you,' said Dorcas, placing her arms gently about her neck, and kissing her twice or thrice.
5683_32879_000048_000000 'Rachel, dear, I have a plan for you and me: we shall be old maids, you and I, and live together like the ladies of Llangollen, careless and happy recluses.
5683_32879_000048_000002 We will make a little tour together, when all this shall have blown over, in a few weeks, and choose our retreat; and with the winter's snow we'll vanish from Brandon, and appear with the early flowers at our cottage among the beautiful woods and hills of Wales.
5683_32879_000006_000000 'Better to day, Tamar?' enquired this grand and beautiful young lady.
5683_32879_000027_000001 I ought not to have doubted you,' and she kissed her again.
5683_32879_000048_000003 Will you come, Rachel?'
5683_32879_000002_000000 CHAPTER twenty four.
5683_32879_000019_000000 'No, darling, not yet; it is very good of you.'
5683_32879_000022_000000 Poor Rachel! her nature recoiled from deceit, and she told, at all events, as much of the truth as she dared.
5683_32879_000014_000002 'You have been more ill than I thought, darling, and you are still far from quite recovered.'
5683_32879_000041_000000 'I'm only disappointed, Rachel; I thought you would have trusted me, as I did you.'
3575_170457_000010_000007 At first, I could not say 'Thy will be done!' I felt rebellious, but I knew it was wrong to feel so.
3575_170457_000033_000000 "And now, madam, God bless you!
3575_170457_000041_000003 The former from reserve, the latter from timidity, avoided all friendships and intimacies beyond their family. Emily was impervious to influence; she never came in contact with public opinion, and her own decision of what was right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance, with which she allowed no one to interfere. Her love was poured out on Anne, as Charlotte's was on her.
3575_170457_000032_000001 Take care of over excitement, and endeavour to keep a quiet mind (even for your health it is the best advice that can be given you): your moral and spiritual improvement will then keep pace with the culture of your intellectual powers.
3575_170457_000048_000000 Stung by anxiety for this little sister, she upbraided Miss W--- for her fancied indifference to Anne's state of health.
3575_170457_000016_000005 Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be.
3575_170457_000044_000011 I am not good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society.
3575_170457_000012_000003 He spoke French perfectly, I have been told, when need was; but delighted usually in talking the broadest Yorkshire.
3575_170457_000012_000007 And so life and death have dispersed the circle of "violent Radicals and Dissenters" into which, twenty years ago, the little, quiet, resolute clergyman's daughter was received, and by whom she was truly loved and honoured.
3575_170457_000024_000010 In the evenings, I confess, I do think, but I never trouble any one else with my thoughts.
3575_170457_000023_000002 I must suppress what I feel, or you will think me foolishly enthusiastic.
3575_170457_000040_000004 And, meantime, I know the greatness of Jehovah; I acknowledge the perfection of His word; I adore the purity of the Christian faith; my theory is right, my practice horribly wrong."
3575_170457_000024_000016 That letter is consecrated; no one shall ever see it, but papa and my brother and sisters.
3575_170457_000010_000002 It is an inscrutable fatality.
3575_170457_000022_000000 "Sir, march sixteenth.

3575_170457_000010_000000 "What shall I do without you?
3575_170457_000044_000014 Papa says he highly approves of my friendship with you, and he wishes me to continue it through life."
3575_170457_000030_000000 "Dear Madam,
3575_170457_000024_000006 My father is a clergyman of limited, though competent income, and I am the eldest of his children.
3575_170457_000046_000002 But Miss Branwell persevered; urged economical motives; pressed on his love for his daughters.
3575_170457_000017_000001 I only exhort you so to think of it, and so to use it, as to render it conducive to your own permanent good.
3575_170457_000016_000004 The day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely to induce a distempered state of mind; and in proportion as all the ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable, you will be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else.

3575_170457_000015_000003 Whoever, therefore, is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment.
3575_170457_000024_000004 I am afraid, sir, you think me very foolish.
3575_170457_000016_000008 You will not seek in imagination for excitement, of which the vicissitudes of this life, and the anxieties from which you must not hope to be exempted, be your state what it may, will bring with them but too much.
3575_170457_000046_000003 He gave way.
3575_170457_000050_000002 For some unexplained reason, he had given up the idea of becoming a student of painting at the Royal Academy, and his prospects in life were uncertain, and had yet to be settled.
3575_170457_000010_000004 You first pointed out to me that way in which I am so feebly endeavouring to travel, and now I cannot keep you by my side, I must proceed sorrowfully alone.
3575_170457_000046_000001 He refused at first to listen to the careful advice; it was repugnant to his liberal nature.

3575_170457_000010_000001 How long are we likely to be separated? Why are we to be denied each other's society?

3575_170457_000035_000000 "ROBERT SOUTHEY.
3575_170457_000037_000002 On august twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven, she writes:--
3575_170457_000021_000000 It is partly because I think it so admirable, and partly because it tends to bring out her character, as shown in the following reply, that I have taken the liberty of inserting the foregoing extracts from it.
3575_170457_000031_000002 Let me now request that, if you ever should come to these Lakes while I am living here, you will let me see you.
4077_13751_000007_000000 Let us observe the contrast between the beginning and the present proportions of the Church.
4077_13751_000011_000000 Within two years of its dedication, the temple in Kirtland was abandoned by the people, who were compelled to flee for their lives before the onslaughts of mobocrats; but a second temple, larger and more beautiful than the first, soon reared its spires in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois.
4077_13751_000019_000007 American school boys read with emotions of horror of the Albigenses, driven, beaten and killed, with a papal legate directing the butchery; and of the Vaudois, hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree; and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.
4077_13751_000019_000005 The awful work was carried out with dread dispatch.
4077_13751_000023_000005 Have any who plundered and openly insulted the "Mormons" ever been brought to the punishment due to their crimes? Let boasting murderers of begging and helpless infancy answer!
4077_13751_000008_000001 Their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun-not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west, but that the headquarters of the Church should be there established.
4077_13751_000006_000008 At first but a family affair, opposition to the work has involved successively the town, the county, the state, the country, and today the "Mormon" question has been accorded extended consideration at the hands of the national government, and indeed most civilized nations have taken cognizance of the same.
4077_13751_000014_000008 Their gathering is to be like that of the Jews at Jerusalem-a pacific one, and in their taking possession of what they regard as a land of promise, no one previously located there shall be denied his rights.
4077_13751_000025_000000 We have no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our indignation and shame at the recent transaction in a sister state, and that state, Missouri, a state of which we had long been proud, alike for her men and history, but now so fallen that we could wish her star stricken from the bright constellation of the Union.
4077_13751_000010_000000 The first well established seat of the Church was in the pretty little town of Kirtland, Ohio, almost within sight of Lake Erie; and here soon rose the first temple of modern times.
4077_13751_000006_000004 At that time there may have been and probably were many times that number who had professed adherence to the newly restored faith; but as the requirements of the law governing the formation of religious societies were satisfied by the application of six, only the specified number formally took part. Such was the beginning of the Church, soon to be so universally maligned.
4077_13751_000019_000006 Oh, what a record to read; what a picture to gaze upon; how awful the fact! An official edict offering expatriation or death to a peaceable community with no crime proved against them, and guilty of no offense other than that of choosing to differ in opinion from the masses!
4077_13751_000019_000004 What the heart of man can conceive, the hand of man will find a way to execute.
4077_13751_000023_000000 Who began the quarrel?
4077_13751_000015_000001 An appeal was made to the executive of the state, but little encouragement was returned.
4077_13751_000019_000003 But tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have been, for murder and its kindred outrages.
4077_13751_000023_000001 Was it the "Mormons?" Is it not notorious on the contrary that they were hunted like wild beasts from county to county before they made any resistance?
4077_13751_000018_000003 No respect was paid to age or sex; grey heads, and infant lips that scarcely had learned to lisp a word, vigorous manhood and immature youth, mother and maiden, fared alike in the scene of carnage, and their bodies were thrown into an old well.
4077_13751_000007_000004 Nevertheless, the mustard seed, among the smallest of all seeds, has attained the proportions of a tree, and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches; the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth.
4077_13751_000017_000005 The national executive, Andrew Jackson, while expressing sympathy for the persecuted people, deplored his lack of power to interfere with the administration or non administration of state laws; the national officials could do nothing; the state officials would do naught.
4077_13751_000020_000003 There their sad condition evoked for a time general commiseration.
4077_13751_000006_000005 Its origin was small-a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
4077_13754_000013_000001 The Latter day Saints were long regarded as a polygamous people.
4077_13754_000004_000003 When the history of that great struggle with its antecedent and its consequent circumstances is written with a pen that shall indite naught but truth, when prejudice and partisanship are lived down, it may appear that Jefferson Davis rather than james Buchanan was the prime cause of the great mistake.
4077_13754_000013_000005 Yet the two have often been confused in the popular mind.
4077_13754_000006_000002 And surely such conjectures were pardonable on the part of all whose ignorance and prejudice still nursed the delusion of "Mormon" disloyalty. Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished?
4077_13754_000008_000000 The "Mormon" people saw in their terrible experiences and in the outrages to which they had been subjected, only the mal administration of laws and the subversion of justice through human incapacity and hatred.
4077_13754_000001_000000 After all, the "Mormon" people regard the advent of the Buchanan army as one of the greatest material blessings ever brought to them.
4077_13754_000003_000002 But a word further concerning the expedition in general.
4077_13754_000017_000001 This statement assumes, as granted, a distinction between bigamy and the "Mormon" institution of plural marriage.
4077_13754_000004_000000 However, it was known that certain of his cabinet were in league with the seceding states; and prominent among them was john Floyd, secretary of war.
4077_13754_000003_000000 And what was the cause of this hurried departure of the military? For many months, ominous rumblings had been heard,--indications of the gathering storm which was soon to break in the awful fury of civil strife.
4077_13754_000016_000001 To them marriage is not, can never be, a civil compact alone; its significance reaches beyond the grave; its obligations are eternal; and the Latter day Saints are notable for the sanctity with which they invest the marital state.
4077_13754_000023_000004 Its creed provides for the protection of all men in their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience.
4077_13754_000002_000000 The troops, once in Utah, had to be provisioned; and everything the settlers could spare was eagerly bought at an unusual price. The gold changed hands.
4077_13754_000014_000001 We believe, further that contracts as of marriage, to be valid beyond the veil of mortality must be sanctioned by a power greater than that of earth.
4077_13754_000020_000000 The people contested these measures one by one in the courts; presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject, and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.
4077_13754_000002_000002 The army found the people in poverty, and left them in comparative wealth.
4077_13754_000003_000001 It could not be doubted that war was imminent; already the conflict had begun, and a picked part of the army was away in the western wilds, doing nothing for any phase of the public good.
4077_13754_000014_000000 We believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter, in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth-of parent and child, brother and sister, husband and wife.
4077_13754_000006_000003 Already a North and a South were talked of-why not set up also a West?
4077_13754_000003_000004 The movement has been called not inaptly "Buchanan's blunder," but the best and wisest men may make blunders, and whatever may be said of President Buchanan's short sightedness in taking this step, even his enemies do not question his integrity in the matter.
4077_13754_000023_000001 Today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is stronger than ever before; and the people are confident that it is at its weakest stage for all time to come.
4077_13754_000004_000002 It is also told how, at the commencement of the rebellion, he allied himself with the confederate forces, accepting the rank of brigadier general. It was through Floyd's advice that Buchanan ordered the military expedition to Utah, ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists.
4077_13754_000010_000002 But "Mormonism" died not; every added pang of grief served but to unite the people.
4077_13754_000013_000000 But perhaps I am suspected of having forgotten or of having intentionally omitted reference to what popular belief once considered the chief feature of "Mormonism," the cornerstone of the structure, the secret of its influence over its members, and of its attractiveness to its proselytes, viz., the peculiarity of the "Mormon" institution of marriage.
4077_13754_000002_000001 Then, in their hasty departure, the soldiers disposed of everything outside of actual necessities in the way of accouterment and camp equipage.
4077_13754_000011_000003 He was a man with clear title as one of the small brotherhood we call great.
4077_13754_000011_000006 With his death closed another epoch in the history of his people, and a successor arose, one who was capable of leading and judging under the changed conditions.
4077_13754_000017_000002 In eighteen sixty two, a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage, and, as had been predicted in the national Senate prior to its passage, it lay for many years a dead letter.
4077_13754_000017_000000 At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter day Saints, there was no law, national or state, against its practise.
4077_13754_000017_000003 Federal judges and United States attorneys in Utah, who were not "Mormons" nor lovers of "Mormonism," refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law, because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy. But other laws followed, most of which, as the Latter day Saints believe, were aimed directly at their religious conception of the marriage contract, and not at social impropriety nor sexual offense.
4077_13754_000005_000001 He left Utah in the early stages of the rebellion, turned his arms against the flag he had sworn to defend, doffed the blue, donned the grey, and fell a rebel on the field of Shiloh.
4077_13754_000018_000000 At last the Edmunds Tucker act took effect, making not the marriage alone but the subsequent acknowledging of the contract an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.
4077_13754_000021_000000 As the people had adopted the practise under what was believed to be divine approval, they suspended it when they were justified in so doing.
4077_13754_000014_000002 With the seal of the holy Priesthood upon their wedded state, these people believe implicitly in the perpetuity of that relationship on the far side of the grave.
4077_13754_000006_000001 The people were besought to take sides with the South in the awful scenes of cruel strife; it was openly stated in the east that Utah had allied herself with the cause of secession; and by others that the design was to make Salt Lake City the capital of an independent government.
4077_13754_000006_000004 A supreme opportunity had come and how was it used?
4077_13754_000006_000000 Changes many and great followed in bewildering succession in Utah.
4077_13754_000014_000004 Sad as have been the experiences of the people in consequence of this practise, deep and anguish laden as have been the sighs and groans, hot and bitter as have been the tears so caused, the heaviest persecution, the cruelest treatment of their history began before plural marriage was known in the Church.
4077_13754_000003_000005 He was unjustly charged with favoring secession; but the charge was soon disproved.
4077_13754_000004_000001 The successful efforts of this officer to disarm the North, while accumulating the munitions of war in the South; to scatter the forces by locating them in widely separated and remote stations; and in other ways to dispose of the regular army in the manner best calculated to favor the anticipated rebellion, are matters of history.
4077_13754_000010_000000 But let us turn more particularly to the history of the Church itself.
4077_13754_000021_000001 In whatever light this practise has been regarded in the past, it is today a dead issue, forbidden by ecclesiastical rule as it is prohibited by legal statute.
4077_13754_000021_000002 And the world is learning, to its manifest surprise, that plural marriage and "Mormonism" are not synonymous terms.
4077_13754_000023_000000 And so the story of "Mormonism" runs on; its finale has not yet been written; the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.
4077_13754_000020_000002 But the people have suspended the practise of plural marriage; and the testimony of the governors, judges, and district attorneys of the territory, and later that of the officers of the state, have declared the sincerity of the renunciation.
6930_75918_000042_000000 "What I said to him, count," replied Raoul, "I will repeat to you. Listen to me.
6930_75918_000031_000000 "I am fatigued."
6930_75918_000034_000000 "What annoyance?"
6930_75918_000048_000000 "Do you wish it?"
6930_75918_000005_000000 "Yes; bodily."
6930_75918_000032_000001 Believe me, it is not fatigue that saddens you to night."
6930_75918_000050_000000 "I leave you, then," said Raoul, as he withdrew.
6930_75918_000009_000000 "No; I wish to talk to you."
6930_75918_000001_000000 Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.
6930_75918_000004_000000 "Bodily, I suppose?"
6930_75918_000035_000000 "That of this evening."
6930_75918_000050_000001 The count advanced a step towards his friend, and pressed him warmly in his arms.
6930_75918_000038_000000 "Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be apprehended from Buckingham."
6930_75918_000000_000001 Night.
6930_75918_000015_000000 "I suspect."
6930_75918_000003_000000 "Cruelly."
6930_75918_000017_000000 "One could almost swear to it, to observe him."
6930_75918_000023_000000 "Nay, where it does exist."
6930_75918_000029_000000 "What do you mean?"
6930_75918_000039_000000 "No; still he is intrusive.
6930_76324_000025_000001 "I'm just dog tired!"
6930_76324_000030_000000 "'tuesday april sixteenth eighteen sixty one.'"
6930_76324_000020_000000 "Of course not," said Joyce.
6930_76324_000022_000000 "Perhaps that's so," admitted Joyce, thoughtfully.
6930_76324_000002_000004 These two cherubic infants had both big brown eyes, fat red cheeks, and adorable, fluffy golden curls.
6930_76324_000010_000004 But let's go and finish our studying now, and get that out of the way.
6930_76324_000005_000001 "I thought we were 'stumped' again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use, after all.
6930_76324_000019_000004 I wonder, though, if people could see the light from the street, through any chinks in the boarding?"
6930_76324_000002_000000 They were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem.
6930_76324_000019_000003 But they'll have to do.
6930_76324_000003_000000 "The poor little things!" cried Cynthia.
6930_76324_000014_000003 First they took turns sweeping, as best they could, with a very ancient and frowsy broom, the thick, moth eaten carpet.
6930_76324_000006_000003 Presently she spoke:
6930_76324_000023_000003 There isn't a doubt but what that baby was she."
6930_76324_000005_000000 "You must be right," admitted Cynthia.
6930_76324_000004_000000 "I've got it!" she announced.
6930_76324_000026_000003 I just touched something soft!" On the instant, Joyce was at her side with the candle.
6930_81414_000001_000000 CHAPTER eleven
6930_81414_000043_000001 "I think I am ill."
6930_81414_000038_000001 "Look, mr Blake; do you recognize this?"
6930_81414_000046_000004 Undoubtedly the Egyptian knew too much for Voltaire, and so I was made a tool whereby he could be freed from troublesome obstacles.
6930_81414_000028_000001 I-I do not know."
6930_81414_000019_000003 Gradually I knew I was mastering him-then all was blank.
6930_81414_000041_000002 I say you do know what this means, and you must tell us."
6930_81414_000020_000001 A flash of light.
6930_81414_000042_000003 Had I? Had I?
6930_81414_000011_000000 What was that?
6930_81414_000037_000001 "Have we been together?" "That's his knife, at any rate.
6930_81414_000049_000000 "He's better now.
6930_81414_000047_000000 My position was too terrible.
6930_81414_000041_000001 Here is his scarf, which has evidently been strained, and on it are spots of blood, while all around are marks indicating a struggle.
6930_81414_000031_000001 What is that in your hand?"
6930_81414_000029_000000 "But you have been together."
6930_81414_000047_000003 Then I fell down at Tom Temple's feet.
6930_81414_000048_000002 Then I heard Tom say-
6930_81414_000009_000000 I stood alone.
6930_81414_000014_000003 It did not beckon, or indeed move at all; it was as still as the hand of death.
6930_81414_000013_000000 What could it be?
6930_81414_000002_000000 DARK DREAMS AND NIGHT SHADOWS
8230_279154_000013_000002 But apart from this, there are other marks.
8230_279154_000013_000001 There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate memory is concerned.
8230_279154_000004_000009 In this way the whole status of images as "copies" is bound up with the analysis of memory.
8230_279154_000011_000006 Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.
8230_279154_000017_000002 But the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
8230_279154_000024_000000 The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge.
8230_279154_000008_000003 And the same applies to images.
8230_279154_000011_000009 I shall return to the consideration of familiarity shortly.
8230_279154_000027_000004 When we see a cat, we know it is a cat because of previous cats we have seen, but we do not, as a rule, recollect at the moment any particular occasion when we have seen a cat.
8230_279154_000023_000001 I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this.
8230_279154_000004_000008 To deal with this problem, we must have a theory of memory.
8230_279154_000018_000004 In like manner, in the study of memory, the certainties with which you begin are very vague, and the more precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set out.
8230_279154_000008_000000 In the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient to constitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient.
8230_279154_000018_000005 Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.
8230_279154_000009_000001 How is it possible to know that a memory image is an imperfect copy, without having a more accurate copy by which to replace it?
8230_279154_000011_000004 I think the characteristic by which we distinguish the images we trust is the feeling of FAMILIARITY that accompanies them.
8230_279154_000004_000002 Such modifications of Hume's principle, however, do not affect the problem which I wish to present for your consideration, namely: Why do we believe that images are, sometimes or always, approximately or exactly, copies of sensations?
8230_279154_000007_000002 All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
8230_279154_000010_000001 We will take the second of these points first.
8230_279154_000003_000007 The non sensational elements in perception can be wholly explained as the result of habit, produced by frequent correlations.
8230_279154_000021_000002 The definition of truth as the correspondence between beliefs and facts seems peculiarly evident in the case of memory, as against not only the pragmatist definition but also the idealist definition by means of coherence.
8230_279154_000022_000005 But it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. Habit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life, and is often present where at first sight it seems not to be.
8230_279154_000006_000001 In the first place, everything constituting a memory belief is happening now, not in that past time to which the belief is said to refer.
8230_279154_000011_000000 Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image.
8230_279154_000015_000000 We may say, then, that images are regarded by us as more or less accurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with two sorts of feelings: (one) Those that may be called feelings of familiarity; (two) those that may be collected together as feelings giving a sense of pastness.
8230_279154_000006_000004 There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago.
8230_279154_000022_000006 There is, for example, a habit of remembering a unique event.
8230_279154_000006_000003 There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that "remembered" a wholly unreal past.
8230_279154_000022_000002 The recollection of a unique event cannot, so Bergson contends, be wholly constituted by habit, and is in fact something radically different from the memory which is habit.
8230_279154_000004_000003 What sort of evidence is there?
8230_279154_000010_000000 What results, formally, from our knowledge of the past through images of which we recognize the inaccuracy, is that such images must have two characteristics by which we can arrange them in two series, of which one corresponds to the more or less remote period in the past to which they refer, and the other to our greater or less confidence in their accuracy.
8230_279154_000028_000004 I do not wish to undertake the analysis of belief at present, since it will be the subject of the twelfth lecture; for the present I merely wish to emphasize the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in a belief, which we may express approximately in the words: "This has existed before."
8230_279154_000008_000002 "Habit" is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times; if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.
8230_279154_000014_000001 Very often our knowledge of the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present is inferred from its temporal relations to other remembered events.
8230_279154_000026_000003 The feeling of familiarity has all sorts of degrees, down to the stage where we dimly feel that we have seen a person before.
8230_279154_000009_000002 This would SEEM to suggest that we have a way of knowing the past which is independent of images, by means of which we can criticize image memories.
8230_279154_000011_000005 Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
8230_279154_000011_000002 We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust-for example, under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted.
8230_279154_000026_000005 There are occasions when familiarity does not attach itself to any definite object, when there is merely a vague feeling that SOMETHING is familiar.
8230_279154_000021_000003 These considerations, however, are taking us away from psychology, to which we must now return.
8230_279154_000027_000002 We recognize our friend Jones, we know cats and dogs when we see them, and so on.
8230_279154_000024_000006 They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
8230_279154_000026_000000 We often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar, without having any definite recollection of previous occasions on which we have seen it.
8230_279154_000012_000003 The question which of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic serviceability of the characteristic in question.
8230_279154_000029_000002 I am not sure that there is anything substantial in this point.
8230_279154_000029_000001 To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as "I have seen this before" than as "this has existed before." We recognize a thing (it may be urged) as having been in our experience before, whatever that may mean; we do not recognize it as merely having been in the world before.
8230_279154_000009_000003 But I do not think such an inference is warranted.
8230_279154_000027_000006 We are, of course, in fact able to judge, when we recognize an object, that we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.
8230_279154_000002_000000 Memory, which we are to consider to day, introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms.
8230_279154_000012_000000 I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000019_000002 Nevertheless, whatever a sceptic might urge in theory, we cannot practically doubt that we got up this morning, that we did various things yesterday, that a great war has been taking place, and so on.
8230_279154_000014_000002 It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present, but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.
8230_279154_000022_000001 He gives the instance of learning a lesson by heart: when I know it by heart I am said to "remember" it, but this merely means that I have acquired certain habits; on the other hand, my recollection of (say) the second time I read the lesson while I was learning it is the recollection of a unique event, which occurred only once.
8230_279154_000026_000001 We have this feeling normally in places where we have often been before-at home, or in well-known streets.
8230_279154_000001_000001 MEMORY
8230_279154_000024_000003 Similarly, the performances of animals in getting out of cages or mazes to which they are accustomed do not prove that they remember having been in the same situation before. Arguments in favour of (for example) memory in plants are only arguments in favour of habit memory, not of knowledge memory.
8230_279154_000028_000003 It differs from the sense of familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or judgment, which the sense of familiarity is not.
8230_279154_000006_000005 Hence the occurrences which are CALLED knowledge of the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly analysable into present contents, which might, theoretically, be just what they are even if no past had existed.
8230_279154_000017_000000 If we had retained the "subject" or "act" in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
8230_279154_000027_000000 A further stage is RECOGNITION.
8230_279154_000004_000005 The difficulty of this question arises through the fact that the sensation which an image is supposed to copy is in the past when the image exists, and can therefore only be known by memory, while, on the other hand, memory of past sensations seems only possible by means of present images.
8230_279154_000012_000002 That is to say if we suppose that A is the event remembered, B the remembering, and t the interval of time between A and B, there must be some characteristic of B which is capable of degrees, and which, in accurately dated memories, varies as t varies. It may increase as t increases, or diminish as t increases.
8230_279154_000029_000003 The definition of "my experience" is difficult; broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
8230_279154_000003_000004 It might, however, have been expected that we should begin our discussion of knowledge with PERCEPTION, i e with that integral experience of things in the environment, out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis.
8230_279154_000027_000003 Here we have a definite influence of past experience, but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000011_000008 I think it is by this means that we become critical of images, not by some imageless memory with which we compare them.
8230_279154_000004_000000 One reason for treating memory at this early stage is that it seems to be involved in the fact that images are recognized as "copies" of past sensible experience.
8230_279154_000018_000002 The study of any topic is like the continued observation of an object which is approaching us along a road: what is certain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is SOME object on the road.
8230_279154_000017_000003 Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is remembered.
8230_279154_000003_000001 I shall discuss this question in later lectures.
8230_279154_000011_000003 In such a case we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
8230_279154_000013_000004 A recent memory has, usually, more context than a more distant one.
8230_279154_000008_000004 If we are to know as it is supposed we do-that images are "copies," accurate or inaccurate, of past events, something more than the mere occurrence of images must go to constitute this knowledge.
8230_279154_000026_000008 The judgment that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of reflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable.
8230_279154_000022_000007 When we have once described the event, the words we have used easily become habitual.
8230_279154_000011_000007 In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others; when this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
8230_279154_000026_000009 Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
8230_279154_000012_000001 They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
8230_279154_000029_000005 Of course, the words "this has existed before" are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable: words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.
8230_279154_000022_000008 We may even have used words to describe it to ourselves while it was happening; in that case, the habit of these words may fulfil the function of Bergson's true memory, while in reality it is nothing but habit memory.
8230_279154_000021_000001 It seems clear that some of the things I remember are trivial and without any visible importance for the future, but that my memory is true (or false) in virtue of a past event, not in virtue of any future consequences of my belief.
8230_279154_000028_000002 It does not involve a definite memory of a definite past event, but only the knowledge that something happening now is similar to something that happened before.
8230_279154_000002_000001 The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
8230_279154_000024_000005 Semon's two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.
8230_279154_000007_000000 I am not suggesting that the non existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
8230_279154_000023_000002 It is this sort of occurrence that constitutes the essence of memory Until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this, we have not succeeded in understanding memory.
8230_279154_000022_000004 This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory.
8230_279154_000026_000004 It is by no means always reliable; almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
8230_279154_000024_000002 The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
8230_279154_000022_000009 A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past; and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
8230_279154_000027_000005 Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association: the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word "cat," or with an auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
8230_279154_000020_000000 The second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for knowing the past than for knowing the future.
8230_279154_000021_000000 A third point, perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two, is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists wish all truth to be.
8230_279154_000014_000000 There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
8230_279154_000019_000000 The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000027_000001 This may be taken in two senses, the first when a thing not merely feels familiar, but we know it is such and such.
8230_279154_000011_000001 It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
8230_279154_000013_000003 One of these is context.
8230_279154_000007_000001 Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable, but uninteresting.
8230_279154_000022_000000 It is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which Bergson distinguishes in the second chapter of his "Matter and Memory," namely the sort that consists of habit, and the sort that consists of independent recollection.
8230_279154_000004_000006 How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
8230_279154_000003_000006 The FACT of past experience is essential in producing this filling out of sensation, but not the RECOLLECTION of past experience.
8230_279154_000017_000004 And it is difficult to find any ground, except a pragmatic one, for supposing that memory is not sheer delusion, if, as seems to be the case, there is not, apart from memory, any way of ascertaining that there really was a past occurrence having the required relation to our present remembering.
8230_279154_000019_000003 How far our knowledge of the past is due to memory, and how far to other sources, is of course a matter to be investigated, but there can be no doubt that memory forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000028_000001 This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
8230_279154_000004_000004 And what sort of evidence is logically possible?
8230_279154_000006_000002 It is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory belief that the event remembered should have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all.
8230_279154_000003_000005 What is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates-images and expectations of their usual correlates-all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation.
8230_279154_000003_000009 The purely psychological problems which it raises are not very difficult, though they have sometimes been rendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non sensational elements of perception.
8230_279154_000003_000003 Sensation, we decided, is not a form of knowledge.
8230_279154_000024_000007 It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.
8230_279154_000024_000008 I shall speak of it as "true" memory, to distinguish it from mere habit acquired through past experience.
8230_279154_000022_000003 The recollection alone is true memory.
8230_279154_000024_000009 Before considering true memory, it will be well to consider two things which are on the way towards memory, namely the feeling of familiarity and recognition.
8230_279154_000026_000002 Most people and animals find it essential to their happiness to spend a good deal of their time in familiar surroundings, which are especially comforting when any danger threatens.
8230_279154_000008_000005 For their mere occurrence, by itself, would not suggest any connection with anything that had happened before.
8230_279154_000008_000001 The behaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour, has to trust his memory in making the record.
8230_279154_000029_000004 Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of "my experience" by DEFINITION: recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
8230_279154_000018_000000 Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
8230_279154_000003_000002 In the present lecture I shall attempt the analysis of memory knowledge, both as an introduction to the problem of knowledge in general, and because memory, in some form, is presupposed in almost all other knowledge.
8455_210777_000010_000000 "Quite satisfied," said Eva.
8455_210777_000018_000000 Then we began to think of the hospitality of the island, and the officers of the john Bright were asked to dine with us on the following day.
8455_210777_000034_000000 "And that in opposition to the wishes, as I understand, of a large proportion of your fellow citizens?"
8455_210777_000064_000000 In regard to Mr Neverbend himself, it is the especial wish of h m
8455_210777_000056_000000 "What world-wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses!" said I, still turning myself to the captain; for though I would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible, my dislike centred itself on Sir Ferdinando.
8455_210777_000013_000000 "Their masters," said Mrs Neverbend.
8455_210777_000053_000000 "Lieutenant Crosstrees has sealed orders, and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun.
8455_210777_000061_000004 The country has since undoubtedly prospered, and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret.
8455_210777_000003_000003 And even had I succeeded in carrying my success so far as that, should I not have appeared a murderer to my fellow citizens had not his departure been followed in regular sequence by that of all others till it had come to my turn? Had Crasweller departed, and had the system then been stopped, should I not have appeared a murderer even to myself?
8455_210777_000029_000003 Therefore, I feel myself quite able, as President of this republic, to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally."
8455_210777_000084_000002 And this plan was adopted, too, in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace. At any rate, I did make the promise, and gave these two gentlemen my word that I would be present there in my own room in the executive chambers at the same hour on the day but one following.
8455_210777_000018_000011 He was quiet, and I might almost say silent, during the whole evening; but I could see from the testimony of his altered countenance how strong is the passion for life that dwells in the human breast.
8455_210777_000063_000000 To enable you to effect this, Captain Battleax, of h m gunboat the john Bright, has been instructed to carry you out.
8455_210777_000023_000010 Mrs Neverbend should come with me, or stay, if it so pleased her, in Gladstonopolis.
8455_210777_000061_000007 At the present moment a law has been passed which, if carried into action, would become abhorrent to mankind at large.
8455_210777_000069_000000 "To day!" I shouted.
8455_210777_000023_000003 Every hope for which I had lived, as I then told myself, had been brought to sudden extinction by the coming of these men to whom I had been so pleasant, and who, in their turn, had been so pleasant to me!
8455_210777_000023_000011 Jack would become Eva's happy husband, and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world. Crasweller, the triumphant, would live, and at last die, amidst the flocks and herds of Little Christchurch.
8455_210777_000012_000005 No doubt, in process of time the ladies will follow-"
8455_210777_000000_000000 CHAPTER nine.
8455_210777_000072_000000 "Half past ten," said the captain, looking at his watch.
8455_210777_000023_000001 A presentiment indeed!
8455_210777_000012_000003 "You will perceive, Captain Battleax, that there is a little difference of opinion between us all here as to the ceremony which was to have been accomplished this morning.
8455_210777_000057_000001 In the meantime, my friend Captain Battleax has below a guard of fifty marines, who will pay you the respect of escorting you on board with two of the ship's cutters.
8455_210777_000022_000011 We sat with the officers some little time after dinner, and then went ashore.
8455_210777_000005_000004 "Mr President," said he, "I am in command of her Majesty's gunboat, the john Bright, and I have come to pay my respects to the ladies."
8455_210777_000041_000001 But I blushed for its untruth.
8455_210777_000014_000001 "I did not mean," said Captain Battleax, "to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
8455_210777_000061_000003 Minister of the day thought it expedient to grant their request.
8455_210777_000022_000008 He was dressed in simple black, and was clearly not one of the ship's officers; but I could not but suspect at the moment that he was in some special measure concerned in the mission on which the gunboat had been sent. He sat on Mrs Neverbend's left hand, and did seem in some respect to be the chief man on that occasion.
8455_210777_000051_000000 "You may be quite sure it's there," said Captain Battleax, "and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board."
8455_210777_000002_000002 I wept to think that a spirit of honesty should as yet have prevailed so little in the world.
8455_210777_000050_000001 Now, at the close of the twentieth century, could oppression be carried to such a height as this?
8455_210777_000059_000000 "That having all been pleasantly settled," said Sir Ferdinando, with a smile, "I will ask you to read the document by which this duty has been placed in my hands." He then took out of his pocket a letter addressed to him by the Duke of Hatfield, as Minister for the Crown Colonies, and gave it to me to read.
8455_210777_000007_000000 "I have come to your shores, Mr President, with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world."
8455_210777_000053_000001 Lieutenant Crosstrees is a very gallant officer.
8455_210777_000023_000002 How much of evil,--of real accomplished evil,--had there not occurred to me during the last few days!
8455_210777_000018_000003 This, I felt, was paid to me as being President of the republic, and I endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion; but I could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life.
8455_210777_000064_000001 Government that he shall be treated with all respect, and that those honours shall be paid to him which are due to the President of a friendly republic.
8455_210777_000022_000007 At any rate, my eloquence was altogether stopped. The gentleman was named Sir Ferdinando Brown.
8455_210777_000075_000000 "No doubt,--knowing nothing of the forms of our government, or-"
8455_210777_000022_000010 After that there was no attempt at speaking.
8455_210777_000071_000000 "If so, you must be content to take my dead body.
8455_210777_000030_000000 "Very well put," said Sir Ferdinando.
8455_210777_000005_000002 There was Captain Battleax seated there, beautiful with a cocked hat, and an epaulet, and gold braid.
8455_210777_000076_000000 "They, of course, must all be altered."
8455_210777_000081_000001 "It is always well to be on the safe side."
8455_210777_000019_000000 "Your promised bride seems to have it all her own way," said Captain Battleax to Jack, when at last the ladies had withdrawn.
8455_210777_000025_000003 But how can a little State, but a few years old, situated on a small island, far removed from all the centres of civilisation, contend on any point with the owner of the great two hundred fifty-ton swiveller gun?"
8455_210777_000018_000006 Then there were three or four leading men of the community, with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
8455_210777_000018_000002 It seemed as though I were treated with almost royal honour.
8455_210777_000043_000002 And I, looking at the matter from my own point of view, was a husband, the head of a family, a man largely concerned in business,--I was to be carried away in bondage-I, who had done no wrong, had disobeyed no law, who had indeed been conspicuous for my adherence to my duties!
8455_210777_000049_000001 I was to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere,--or drowned upon the voyage, it mattered not which.
8455_210777_000065_000000 Captain Battleax, of the john Bright, will have received a letter to the same effect from the First Lord of the Admiralty, and you will find him ready to co-operate with your Excellency in every respect.--I have the honour to be, sir, your Excellency's most obedient servant,
8455_210777_000008_000002 But, on the whole, we are a prosperous and well satisfied people."
8455_210777_000022_000009 However, he proposed Mrs Neverbend's health and the ladies, and the captain instantly called upon the band to play some favourite tune.
8455_210777_000030_000002 "And now," he continued, "will you answer me one question?"
8455_210777_000009_000000 "We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleax," said my wife.
8455_210777_000063_000001 The john Bright is armed with a weapon of great power, against which it is impossible that the people of Britannula should prevail.
8455_210777_000023_000009 When this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to England, I would retire to a small farm which I possessed at the farthest side of the island, and there in seclusion would I end my days.
8455_210777_000055_000000 "If you will look at the contests throughout the world," said Sir Ferdinando, "you will generally find that the highest respect is paid to the greatest battalions."
8455_210777_000012_000001 And yet that something must be playful in its nature.
8455_210777_000033_000000 I thought for a little what answer it would best become me to give to this question, but I paused only for a moment or two.
8455_210777_000030_000001 I simply bowed to him.
8455_210777_000025_000001 Therefore we can be courteous while we submit.
8455_210777_000087_000000 With this the two gentlemen left the room.
8455_210777_000067_000000 This I read with great attention, while they sat silent.
8455_210777_000021_000000 Of what Mrs Neverbend had gone through in providing birds, beasts, and fishes, not to talk of tarts and jellies, for the dinner of that day, no one but myself can have any idea; but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success.
8455_210777_000052_000001 "What would become of your gun were I to kidnap you?"
8455_210777_000083_000001 This was the first complimentary speech which Sir Ferdinando had made, and I must confess that it was efficacious.
8455_210777_000024_000005 But you must be aware that it has been our intention to interfere with that which you must regard as the performance of a duty."
8455_210777_000012_000000 Then there was a little pause in the conversation, and I felt myself bound to say something as to the violent interruption to which I had this morning been subjected.
8455_210777_000004_000006 Had the telegraph been invented in the days of ancient Rome, would the romans have accepted it, or have stoned Wheatstone? So thinking, I resolved that I was before my age, and that I must pay the allotted penalty.
8455_210777_000003_000001 Had Eva Crasweller not been good looking, had Jack been still at college, had Sir Kennington Oval remained in England, had Mr Bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill,--should I have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend?
8455_210777_000022_000005 When the President of the republic has his health drunk, it is, I conceive, his duty to do so.
8455_210777_000012_000002 I must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind.
8455_210777_000040_000000 "And you are, I am aware, sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so?"
8455_210777_000077_000001 It is quite impossible.
8455_210777_000050_000006 Though you should reduce me to atoms, from them would spring those opinions which would serve altogether to silence your artillery.
8455_210777_000022_000004 Now in spite of what the captain said, I undoubtedly had intended to make a speech.
8455_210777_000011_000000 "I am sure we are all delighted to hear the ladies speak in so pleasant a manner," said First Lieutenant Crosstrees, an officer with whom I have since become particularly intimate.
8455_210777_000024_000002 It seemed to me as he entered the room and took the chair that was offered to him, that he was the greater man of the two on the occasion,--or perhaps I should say of the three. And yet he had not before come on shore to visit me, nor had he made one at our little dinner party.
8455_210777_000014_000002 I am here only to pay my respects as a messenger from Great Britain to Britannula, to congratulate you all on your late victory at cricket, and to say how loud are the praises bestowed on Mr john Neverbend, junior, for his skill and gallantry.
8455_210777_000014_000000 This was a pretty little speech enough, and received the eager compliments of the officers of the john Bright.
8455_210777_000008_000000 "Things were progressing, Captain Battleax, pretty well before this morning.
8455_210777_000079_000000 Alas!
8455_210777_000079_000002 All this I could hardly explain to him, as I should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy.
8455_210777_000068_000001 Will twelve o'clock suit you?"
8455_210777_000050_000005 On myself, I need hardly say that it would be inoperative.
8455_210777_000003_000004 And what hope had there been, what reasonable expectation, that the system should have been allowed fair play?
8455_210777_000068_000000 "We have already lighted our fires, and our sailors are weighing the anchors.
8455_210777_000062_000005 It is therefore desired that you should endeavour to obtain information as to his intentions; and that, if the Fixed Period be not abandoned altogether, with a clear conviction as to its cruelty on the part of the inhabitants generally, you should cause him to be carried away and brought to England.
8455_210777_000003_000000 I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
8455_210777_000025_000000 "It is a duty," said i "But your power is so superior to any that I can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.
8455_210777_000014_000004 We had received details of the whole affair by water telegram before the john Bright started.
8455_210777_000026_000000 "That is all quite true, Mr Neverbend," said Sir Ferdinando Brown.
8455_210777_000022_000003 And immediately on his sitting down, there got up a gentleman to whom I had not been introduced before this day, and gave the health of Mrs Neverbend and the ladies of Britannula.
8455_210777_000054_000001 "It is simply a contest between brute strength and mental energy."
8455_210777_000018_000010 I did once or twice during the festivity glance round at old Crasweller.
8455_210777_000048_000000 "But what is the delicate mission?" I asked.
8455_210777_000015_000000 Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva, and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
7127_75946_000029_000000 "My affairs concern myself alone, monsieur; and I have already told you I transact them without interference."
7127_75946_000040_000000 The theater represented a grove of trees; a few fauns lifting up their cloven feet were jumping about; a dryad made her appearance on the scene, and was immediately pursued by them; others gathered round her for her defense, and they quarrelled as they danced.
7127_75946_000061_000004 The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.
7127_75946_000043_000000 "Nothing whatever," replied the courtier, as pale as death; "but your majesty has not thought of Fruits."
7127_75946_000054_000000 The king felt himself color deeply, and said, "You are probably mistaken."
7127_75946_000002_000001 As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and how to perform it.
7127_75946_000022_000001 He has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are required, which is the case at the present moment.
7127_75946_000017_000000 "Entirely?"
7127_75946_000059_000000 "Certainly not, sire; but your majesty did not tell me to remain."
7127_75946_000053_000000 "Yes, sire; and ready dressed for the ballet."
7127_75946_000048_000000 "But, come, since-"
7127_75946_000039_000006 By degrees, as the sight became accustomed to so much brilliancy, the rarest beauties appeared to the view, as in the evening sky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then opens them again.
7127_75946_000001_000001 The Ballet of the Seasons.
7127_75946_000056_000000 Louis turned hastily towards the side, and in fact, on his right, brilliant in his character of Autumn, De Guiche awaited until the king should look at him, in order that he might address him.
7127_75946_000040_000002 The Elements, subaltern powers of mythology, together with their attributes, hastened to follow their gracious sovereign.
7127_75946_000002_000002 The king had resolved to make it surprise.
7127_75946_000061_000002 She, however, did not bestow a single glance upon him.
7127_75946_000040_000007 His legs, the best shaped at court, were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose, of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.
7127_75946_000046_000002 It must be suppressed."
7127_75946_000052_000000 "Here?" replied the king, frowning, "here?
7127_75946_000060_000006 The ballet began; the effect was more than beautiful.
7127_75946_000057_000002 I did not wish to be the substance of so dark a shadow to your majesty's elegance, skill, and graceful invention; and I have left my tenants in order to place my services at your majesty's commands."
7127_75946_000060_000004 The king seemed only pleased with every one present.
7127_75946_000030_000000 "Then, I perceive," said Colbert, trembling with anger and fear, "that I have had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty."
7127_75946_000058_000000 Every word fell distinctly, in perfect harmony and eloquence, upon Louis the fourteenth's ears.
7127_75946_000037_000001 "And," added Louis, "as it seems a difficult matter for you, notwithstanding your economy, to defray, with so limited a sum, the expenses which I intend to incur, I will at once sign an order for three millions."
7127_75946_000024_000001 "And yet," he said, "your majesty did not use this language some time ago, when the news about Belle Isle arrived, for instance."
7127_75946_000039_000003 The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform, erected upon the borders of the lake, in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.
7127_75946_000027_000000 "In my thoughts, monsieur, everything has changed."
7127_75946_000060_000002 Her look had said to him: "Since they are jealous of you, divide their suspicions, for the man who distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular." So that Madame, by this clever diversion, decided him.
7127_75946_000037_000000 "You will take them from my private treasure." Colbert bowed.
7127_75946_000060_000007 When the music, by its bursts of melody, carried away these illustrious dancers, when the simple, untutored pantomime of that period, only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors, had reached its culminating point of triumph, the theater shook with tumultuous applause.
7127_75946_000031_000000 "Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me."
7127_75946_000026_000000 "Nothing, however, has changed since then; on the contrary, indeed."
7127_75946_000016_000000 "Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the cooks, have swallowed up four millions in eight days."
7127_75946_000040_000011 His entrance produced, therefore, the most brilliant effect.
7127_75946_000015_000000 "Well?"
7127_75946_000044_000000 "Yes; it is suppressed."
7127_75946_000050_000000 "But what?"
7127_75946_000041_000001 The applause continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king.
7127_75946_000060_000005 Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
7127_75946_000014_000000 "Sire, they were sent at the hour promised."
7127_75946_000060_000003 The king smiled upon De Guiche, who did not comprehend a word of Madame's dumb language, but he remarked that she pretended not to look at him, and he attributed the pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princess's kindness of heart.
7127_75946_000036_000000 "Seven hundred thousand francs, sire."
7127_75946_000012_000000 "Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that."
7127_75946_000039_000002 At the same moment, as if by enchantment, every one who knew how to hold a needle, every one who could distinguish a coat from a pair of trousers, was summoned to the assistance of those who had received invitations. The king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock; he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
7127_75946_000018_000000 "To the last penny.
7127_75946_000040_000001 Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance.
7127_75946_000040_000010 Such was the prince of that period: justly that evening styled "The King of all the Loves." There was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along.
7127_75946_000040_000003 The Seasons, allies of Spring, followed him closely, to form a quadrille, which, after many words of more or less flattering import, was the commencement of the dance.
7127_75946_000021_000000 "What do you mean?" inquired Louis.
7127_75946_000060_000001 Besides, the king's heart was filled with two or three new ideas; he had just derived fresh inspiration from the eloquent glances of Madame.
7127_75946_000052_000001 Are you sure?"
7127_75946_000045_000000 "Far from it, sire; your majesty having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it."
7127_75946_000033_000000 "I reserve your services for a better occasion; and believe me, they will only be the better appreciated."
7127_75946_000039_000001 The news circulated with the rapidity of lightning; during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition.
7127_75946_000040_000004 The music, hautboys, flutes, and viols, was delightfully descriptive of rural delights.
7127_75946_000061_000001 Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess.
7127_75946_000040_000008 The most beautiful pale lilac satin shoes, with bows of flowers and leaves, imprisoned his small feet.
7127_75946_000040_000006 He was dressed in a tunic of flowers, which set off his graceful and well formed figure to advantage.
7127_75946_000061_000005 De Guiche soon ceased to sustain even the character of the courtier; without applause, he danced indifferently, and very soon could not dance at all, by which accident the triumph of the king and of Madame was assured.
7127_75946_000009_000000 "Why so?"
7127_75946_000022_000002 It is necessary, therefore, that he should comply."
7127_75946_000023_000002 Colbert," said he, accentuating the financier's name, "that is not the way I understood the matter; I do not wish to make use, against any of my servants, of a means of pressure which may oppress him and fetter his services.
7127_75946_000055_000000 "So little is that the case, sire, that if your majesty will look to the right, you will see that the comte is in waiting."
7127_75946_000058_000001 Their flattery pleased, as much as De Guiche's courage had astonished him, and he simply replied: "I did not tell you to return, comte."
7127_75946_000002_000000 At the conclusion of the banquet, which was served at five o'clock, the king entered his cabinet, where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing Spring, which was the result of so much imagination, and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court.
7127_75947_000057_000000 "Yes."
7127_75947_000032_000000 "And yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness."
7127_75947_000037_000000 "Have I offended you again?" said De Guiche.
7127_75947_000012_000000 "Oh! there can be no doubt of it."
7127_75947_000016_000000 "I allude to the goddess."
7127_75947_000021_000000 "no"
7127_75947_000053_000001 "Do you, who are so clever, finish for me."
7127_75947_000055_000005 Out yonder all are at this moment seated at table and fully occupied, or preparing to adorn themselves for a set and formal promenade; horses are being saddled, or harnessed to the carriages-the queen's mules or Madame's four white ponies.
7127_75947_000065_000001 "If I had only seen her, I should have declared it to be a vision, but I spoke to her."
7127_75947_000031_000000 "Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying; a thousand times forgive me; Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely turned my brain."
7127_75947_000029_000001 Ah!
7127_75947_000023_000001 De Guiche had overheard everything.
7127_75947_000081_000000 "So much the better," said Athenais, "because I see the torches setting out from the chateau and the theater, and they seem as if they were preceding some person of distinction."
7127_75947_000039_000000 "Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend, such as yourself?"
7127_75947_000029_000003 Do you love any one?"
7127_75947_000050_000000 "In other words," said Montalais, "she is insupportable.
7127_75947_000068_000000 "In what way?"
7127_75947_000006_000001 He then turned towards Madame, for the purpose of admiring her also a little in her turn.
7127_75947_000082_000004 At this moment, a man, concealed in a dry ditch planted with young willow saplings, scrambled quickly up its shelving side, and ran off in the direction of the chateau.
7127_75947_000056_000000 "And confidences too?"
7127_75947_000067_000000 "Yes; but perhaps I frightened her."
7127_75947_000025_000000 "Pray do not leave me," said De Guiche, stretching out his hand towards her, "for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just pronounced.
7127_75947_000025_000004 Oh!
7127_75947_000006_000000 The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be.
7127_75947_000025_000003 Well, I can understand it; all women who are possessed of any feeling do, and one never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex of these exciting amusements.
7127_75947_000047_000000 "But surely the enchanting spectacle?"
7127_75947_000006_000007 All these sufferings, successes, and remarks were blended, confounded, and lost in the uproar of applause.
7127_75947_000055_000006 As for ourselves, we shall soon reach some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow ours.
7127_75947_000082_000008 Near the songster, in the dark background of the large trees, could be seen the glistening eyes of an owl, attracted by the harmony.
7127_75947_000013_000000 "Explain yourself?"
7127_75947_000065_000000 The two young men approached still closer, conversing in animated tones. "She was here just now," said the count.
7127_75947_000037_000001 "In that case I am indeed unhappy, and greatly to be pitied."
7127_75947_000023_000004 A quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater; but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back; or perhaps, for love is thus strangely constituted, he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart.
7127_75947_000082_000005 The three young girls, on their side, reached the outskirts of the park, every path of which they well knew.
7127_75947_000048_000000 "No more than the dancing.
7127_75947_000052_000000 "Well!" said Montalais, "you do not finish."
7127_75947_000010_000000 "Yes; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own."
7127_75947_000025_000002 You wish to escape from the merry tumult, and prefer your own society.
7127_75947_000071_000000 "Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she may talk."
7127_75947_000028_000001 It is to your recommendation, I am aware, that I owe my admission among the number of Madame's maids of honor."
7127_75947_000034_000000 "There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission."
7127_75947_000069_000000 "Oh!
7127_75947_000082_000012 Beneath this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and turf in such a manner that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the wearied limbs of man or monarch.
7127_75947_000075_000000 "Well?"
7127_75947_000043_000001 "We thought we should be first at the rendezvous."
7127_75947_000023_000000 She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
7127_75947_000019_000001 The only reply Madame condescended to make was by slightly raising her shoulders, and, as her ladies of honor had discreetly retired while the conversation lasted, she recalled them by a look.
7127_75947_000079_000001 I am speaking seriously," replied Montalais, "and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise?"
7127_75947_000062_000001 The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small-indeed invisible.
7127_75947_000038_000000 "Yes, very unhappy, and very much to be pitied, Monsieur de Guiche, for you seem to be suffering terribly."
7127_75947_000023_000002 The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
7127_75947_000027_000000 "I! oh, no!"
7127_75947_000078_000000 Athenais began to laugh.
7127_75947_000019_000000 With this remark, accompanied by one of those deep sighs which affect the remotest fibers of one's being, his heart burdened with sorrow and throbbing fast, his head on fire, and his gaze wandering, he bowed breathlessly, and withdrew behind the thicket.
7127_75947_000035_000000 "Quite true, and I believe you are right.
7127_75947_000006_000005 It rarely happened that any uneasiness was excited on his account, whenever a question of elegance or taste was under discussion; and De Guiche's defeat was accordingly attributed by the greater number present to his courtier like tact and ability.
7127_75947_000079_000000 "Oh!
7127_75947_000014_000000 "You represented a divinity, beautiful, disdainful, inconstant."
7127_75947_000006_000009 De Guiche, observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth, approached her.
7127_75947_000072_000000 "You do not know Louise, count," said Raoul.
7127_75947_000007_000000 Upon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte, observing.
7127_75947_000069_000001 I was still half crazy at you know what; so that she could hardly have understood what I was saying, and must have grown alarmed."
7127_75947_000033_000001 Received me with kindness-perhaps so-yes-"
7127_75947_000041_000002 His dark shadow glided, lengthening as it disappeared, among the illumined yews and glittering undulations of the water.
7127_75947_000015_000000 "You mean Pomona, comte?"
7127_75947_000023_000009 When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
7127_75947_000036_000001 "Why do you ask?" she inquired.
7127_75947_000029_000002 I remember now, and I congratulate myself.
7127_75947_000043_000000 "What, already here!" they said to her.
7127_75947_000055_000002 We are three in number, we like one another, and the night is lovely.
7127_75947_000025_000001 Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely.
7127_75947_000080_000000 "Come," said La Valliere, "these gentlemen have passed; let us take advantage of our being alone to cross the open ground and so take refuge in the woods."
7127_75947_000055_000003 Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
7127_75947_000009_000000 "Do you think so?" she replied with indifference.
7127_75947_000082_000006 The ditches were bordered by high hedges full of flowers, which on that side protected the foot passengers from being intruded upon by the horses and carriages.
7127_75947_000006_000012 Remarking, therefore, that his obeisance obtained him no acknowledgement, he advanced one step further, and in a voice which he tried, though vainly, to render calm, said: "I have the honor to present my most humble respects to your royal highness."
7127_75947_000026_000001 "You seem agitated."
7127_75947_000033_000000 "Do you think so?
7127_75947_000006_000011 A cold shiver passed through poor De Guiche; he was unprepared for such utter indifference, for he had neither seen nor been told of anything that had taken place, and consequently could guess nothing.
7127_75947_000007_000002 good day!"
7127_75947_000061_000000 "Quick, quick, then, among the high reed grass," said Montalais; "stoop, Athenais, you are so tall."
7127_75947_000054_000000 "And you, Louise?" said Montalais, "does any one please you?"
7127_75947_000023_000007 During this time, at the other end of the theater, near the lake, a young woman was seated, with her eyes fixed upon one of the windows of the theater, from which were issuing streams of light-the window in question being that of the royal box.
7127_75947_000029_000000 "Indeed!
7127_75947_000023_000008 As De Guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting into the fresh air he so much needed, he passed close to this figure and saluted her.
7127_75947_000072_000001 "Louise possesses every virtue, and has not a single fault." And the two young men passed on, and, as they proceeded, their voices were soon lost in the distance.
7127_75947_000006_000004 The victim, however, of all these royal affections and affectations, was poor De Guiche. Every one could observe his agitation and prostration-a prostration which was, indeed, the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side, his head bewildered, and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed.
7127_75947_000025_000005 Heaven!" he exclaimed, suddenly.
7127_75947_000051_000001 "I am a woman; and there are few like me; whoever loves me, flatters me; whoever flatters me, pleases me; and whoever pleases-"
7127_75947_000066_000000 "You are positive, then?"
7127_75947_000082_000002 Montalais agile as a deer, Athenais eager as a young wolf, bounded through the dry grass, and, now and then, some bold Acteon might, by the aid of the faint light, have perceived their straight and well formed limbs somewhat displayed beneath the heavy folds of their satin petticoats.
7127_75947_000023_000006 She saw, but did not look at De Guiche, who, irritated and revengeful, turned his back upon her as she passed him, escorted by her nymphs, and followed by a hundred flatterers.
7127_75947_000077_000002 "Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?
7127_75947_000076_000000 "It seems the king will not consent to it."
6829_68769_000012_000000 They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer.
6829_68769_000007_000002 The young man is guilty, and he must suffer the penalty."
6829_68769_000090_000001 Please look at the matter from a business standpoint.
6829_68769_000065_000002 I've seen lots of that kind in my day.
6829_68769_000030_000000 Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger, and retreated along the passage.
6829_68769_000001_000000 THE FORGED CHECK
6829_68769_000013_000001 Well! what for?" he demanded.
6829_68769_000015_000001 You're no friend of Tom Gates.
6829_68769_000045_000003 I don't say I did right.
6829_68769_000091_000001 Give me a check for a hundred and fifty, and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings."
6829_68769_000058_000001 But I'll have a trial in a few days, they say.
6829_68769_000017_000001 that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor. "You mustn't mind my being gruff and grumpy, mr Forbes.
6829_68769_000005_000004 So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand."
6829_68769_000058_000002 My crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case."
6829_68769_000028_000001 "Will you leave us alone, please, mr Markham?"
6829_68769_000034_000000 "Why did you do it?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000036_000001 He was of sturdy, athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for.
6829_68769_000097_000001 There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.
6829_68769_000098_000001 Why, he's a fool, that's what he is.
6829_68769_000092_000000 Kenneth hesitated a moment.
6829_68769_000053_000001 So the girl saw something must be done and went to work.
6829_68769_000052_000000 "I understand now," said Beth.
6829_68769_000023_000000 "Here's visitors, Tom."
6829_68769_000077_000000 "He's a forger, mr Forbes; a deliberate criminal."
6829_68769_000036_000000 A fresh, wholesome looking boy, was Tom Gates, with steady gray eyes, an intelligent forehead, but a sensitive, rather weak mouth.
6829_68769_000019_000000 "Sure ly!
6829_68769_000053_000002 That's how all the trouble came about."
6829_68769_000055_000000 "Whose name did you sign to the check?" asked Kenneth.
6829_68769_000028_000000 "Miss DeGraf," said Kenneth, noticing the boy's face critically, as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it.
6829_68769_000045_000002 I had to stand by Lucy-she's so sweet and gentle, and so sensitive.
6829_68769_000078_000000 "I admit that.
6829_68769_000029_000002 I'll come and get you then.
6829_68769_000049_000000 "Yes.
6829_68769_000004_000000 "But it was a generous act, too," said Beth.
6829_68769_000046_000000 "Couldn't her parents have helped her?" inquired Kenneth.
6829_68769_000092_000001 He detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates.
6829_68769_000060_000000 "She's at home, I suppose.
6829_68769_000073_000000 "I've been bothered already over your election campaign," resumed the manager, arranging his papers in a bored manner.
6829_68769_000024_000000 "Thank you, mr Markham," replied a quiet voice, as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell.
6829_68769_000056_000003 I was bookkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.
6829_68769_000073_000002 You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the Democratic candidate, and have no sympathy with your side."
6829_68769_000066_000000 "No, mr Markham."
6829_68769_000063_000001 It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend. I'm guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself."
6829_68769_000093_000000 Beth, uneasy at his silence, nudged him.
6829_68769_000097_000000 Kenneth and Beth went away quite happy with their success, and the manager stood in his little window and watched them depart.
6829_68769_000026_000000 "Well, stick it out, old man; don't give in."
6829_68769_000024_000001 "How are you feeling, today?"
6829_68769_000074_000001 I've come to talk with you about young Gates."
6829_68769_000056_000007 He only discharged the man who was responsible for the fire."
6829_68769_000010_000000 "We're going to try it, anyhow," was the prompt decision.
6829_68769_000035_000000 He was silent and turned his face away.
6829_68769_000033_000000 "Yes, sir, I plead guilty, although I've been told I ought not to confess.
6829_68769_000027_000000 "I won't, Tom.
6829_68769_000063_000000 "Thank you, sir.
6829_68769_000045_000000 "No, indeed," he replied, frankly.
6829_68769_000053_000000 "Lucy could have looked after her mother," said young Bates, "but old Will was stubborn and wouldn't let her.
6829_68769_000014_000000 "We wish to talk with him," answered Kenneth.
6829_68769_000085_000000 "It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance."
6829_68769_000006_000000 "He was soft hearted and impetuous," said Beth; "and, being in love, he didn't stop to count the cost."
6829_68769_000016_000000 "I am Kenneth Forbes, of Elmhurst.
6829_68769_000065_000003 You don't smoke, do you, mr Forbes?"
6829_68769_000008_000000 "Is there no way to save him?" asked Kenneth.
6829_68769_000074_000000 "That doesn't interest me, especially, sir," answered Kenneth, smiling. "I'm not electioneering just now.
6829_68769_000011_000001 Fairview was twelve miles away, but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail.
6829_68769_000068_000003 The manager was in, Kenneth and Beth learned, but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the noon mail.
6829_68769_000084_000000 "I'll make your money loss good."
6829_68769_000056_000006 But Marshall never even thanked me.
6829_68769_000041_000000 "Lucy is very proud.
6829_68769_000045_000004 I only say I'd do the same thing again."
6829_68769_000057_000000 "How long ago were you arrested?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000043_000000 "Yes; she'll worry about me, I know.
6829_68769_000100_000000 "I'm so glad, Ken-so glad!
6829_68769_000054_000000 He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them. It was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident.
6829_68769_000056_000005 I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant.
6829_68769_000082_000001 Nevertheless, I should like to save him," said Kenneth.
6829_68769_000011_000000 So as soon as breakfast was over the next morning Beth and Kenneth took one of the automobiles, the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of locomotion because it would save much time.
6829_68769_000094_000000 "Pay it, Ken," she whispered.
6829_68769_000067_000002 And it ruins a man's disposition."
6829_68769_000070_000000 He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.
6829_68769_000089_000001 Why should you do all this?"
6829_68769_000100_000001 And to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars!
6829_68769_000079_000000 "He stole my money."
6829_68769_000029_000003 Sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail.
6829_68769_000002_000000 Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle john of old Will Rogers's visit, but they got mr Watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check.
6829_68769_000091_000000 "You're right.
6829_68769_000007_000001 "Indeed there is never an excuse for crime.
6829_68769_000037_000001 Kenneth decided that he was ill at ease and in a state of dogged self repression.
6829_68769_000022_000000 He unlocked the door, and called:
6829_68769_000016_000001 I'm running for Representative on the Republican ticket," said Kenneth, quietly.
6829_68769_000017_000002 I've just stopped smoking a few days ago, and it's got on my nerves something awful!"
6829_68769_000045_000001 "But it will be best that way.
6829_68769_000019_000001 I'll take you to his cell, myself.
6829_68769_000072_000000 "Yes, sir."
6829_68769_000005_000003 The Squierses are a selfish, hard fisted lot, and the old lady, especially, is a well known virago. But they could not have proven a case against Lucy, if she was innocent, and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff.
6829_68769_000029_000000 "Sure ly, mr Forbes.
6829_68769_000086_000001 I'll pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check, and the withdrawal of the prosecution."
6829_68769_000062_000000 "I'm going to see mr Marshall," said Kenneth, "and discover what I can do to assist you."
6829_68769_000009_000000 "If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check, then the young man would be allowed his freedom. But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made."
6829_68769_000100_000002 And now we must find the girl."
6829_68769_000051_000002 Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around, and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin."
6829_68769_000090_000002 If you send the boy to prison you will still suffer the loss of the money.
6829_68769_000075_000001 Well, sir, what about him?"
6829_68769_000038_000000 "We have heard something of your story," said Kenneth, "and are interested in it.
6829_68769_000098_000002 He might have had that forged check for the face of it, if he'd been sharp. You wouldn't catch 'Rast Hopkins doing such a fool stunt.
6829_68769_000082_000002 "His trial has not yet taken place, and instead of your devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now."
6829_68769_000090_000003 By compromising with me you can recover your loss and are paid for your annoyance."
6829_68769_000090_000000 "I have my own reasons, mr Marshall.
6829_68769_000081_000000 "And he deserves a term in state's prison."
6829_68769_000005_000000 "I can't see it in that light," said the old lawyer.
6829_68769_000015_000000 "Talk! what's the good?
6829_68769_000048_000000 "Oh, did she have an accident?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000051_000001 One morning she tried to light the fire with kerosene, and lost her sight.
6829_68769_000047_000000 "no Old Will is a fine fellow, but poor and helpless since mrs Rogers had her accident."
6829_68769_000005_000001 "It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.
6829_68769_000078_000001 But he's very young, and his youth is largely responsible for his folly."
6829_68769_000044_000000 "Would you like that?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000098_000000 "Of all the easy marks I ever encountered," muttered mr Marshall, "this young Forbes is the easiest.
6829_68769_000049_000002 She's blind."
6829_68769_000068_000000 The mill was at the outskirts of the town.
6829_68769_000056_000001 He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern.
6829_68769_000083_000000 "In what way, mr Forbes?"
6829_68769_000088_000000 "I'll pay all the costs besides."
6829_68769_000050_000000 "Her husband didn't tell us that," said the girl.
6829_68769_000058_000000 "It's nearly two weeks now.
6829_68769_000012_000001 He was a round faced, respectable appearing fellow, but his mood was distinctly unsociable.
6829_68769_000019_000003 Come this way, please."
6829_68769_000051_000000 "He was fairly prosperous before that, for mrs Rogers was an energetic and sensible woman, and kept old Will hard at work.
6829_68769_000032_000000 "We've come to inquire about your case, Gates," said Kenneth.
6829_68769_000068_000001 It was a busy place, perhaps the busiest in the whole of the Eighth District, and in it were employed a large number of men.
6829_68769_000061_000001 It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.
6829_68769_000071_000001 Forbes, of Elmhurst?" he asked, glancing at the card Kenneth had sent in.
6829_68769_000096_000001 He also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to withdraw the prosecution.
6829_68769_000060_000001 I haven't heard from her since the day she came here to see me-right after my arrest."
6829_68771_000022_000000 "Maids?
6829_68771_000017_000000 By ten o'clock the farm wagons began to drive up, loaded with women and children, for all were invited except the grown men.
6829_68771_000015_000002 Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served.
6829_68771_000039_000000 She sat down in a rocking chair, and clasping her hands in her lap, rocked slowly back and forth.
6829_68771_000008_000000 This canvass was quite satisfactory, for final report showed only about a hundred majority for Forbes.
6829_68771_000026_000000 "Come in."
6829_68771_000033_000002 I attend to the household mending, you know, and care for the linen.
6829_68771_000032_000000 "But it can't be," protested the girl.
6829_68771_000049_000000 Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam, and a key clicked in the lock.
6829_68771_000042_000003 You must excuse me."
6829_68771_000044_000007 The thin fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the quiet smile upon the face above them.
6829_68771_000044_000006 However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness, these hands told a different story.
6829_68771_000034_000001 "Where is your home?"
6829_68771_000012_000005 The description she gave of the coming reception to the Woman's Political League was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them, and thus mr Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were.
6829_68771_000029_000001 "Aren't you Lucy Rogers?"
6829_68771_000016_000000 The day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could desire.
6829_68771_000040_000000 "I'm sorry," said Beth.
6829_68771_000032_000001 "How do you know my name, and why haven't I seen you here before?"
6829_68771_000040_000002 There are so many people that we can't give them proper attention."
6829_68771_000010_000001 Monroe County, where both Forbes and Hopkins resided, was one of the Democratic strongholds of the State.
6829_68771_000048_000000 "I will go," said Beth, a little frightened at the passionate appeal.
6829_68771_000019_000001 "Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids?"
6829_68771_000030_000000 The maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise.
6829_68771_000033_000001 "I obtained the situation only a few days ago.
6829_68771_000042_000001 "I abhor crowds.
6829_68771_000027_000001 Standing before her was the young girl she had seen riding with mr Hopkins-the girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of mrs Rogers.
6829_68771_000044_000002 Beth was a beautiful girl-the handsomest of the three cousins, by far; yet Eliza surpassed her in natural charm, and seemed well aware of the fact.
6829_68771_000005_000000 The campaign was now growing warm.
6829_68771_000006_000000 He did not laugh at his opponents any longer.
6829_68771_000046_000001 She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6829_68771_000044_000004 Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go; yet some fascination held her to the spot.
6829_68771_000010_000004 A man named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds, the liveryman, the Democratic nominee.
6829_68771_000014_000000 Louise was making great preparations to entertain the Woman's Political League, an organization she had herself founded, the members of which were wives of farmers in the district.
6829_68771_000018_000003 A speakers' stand, profusely decorated, had been erected on the lawn, and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats.
6829_68771_000031_000001 I'm Elizabeth Parsons."
6829_68771_000010_000007 This "trading votes," which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate.
6829_68771_000028_000000 For a moment Beth stood staring, while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face.
6829_68771_000023_000001 "Where is she, Martha?
6829_68771_000037_000001 "Why cannot you answer it?"
6829_68771_000030_000001 Then she gave a little laugh, and replied:
6829_68771_000044_000003 Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance.
6829_68771_000044_000005 Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
6829_68771_000035_000000 For the first time the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829_68771_000031_000000 "No, Miss Beth.
6829_68771_000012_000002 This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mill.
6829_68771_000022_000002 I counted on Eliza Parsons, the new girl I hired for the linen room and to do mending; but Eliza said she had a headache this morning and couldn't stand the sun, So I let her off.
6829_68771_000010_000000 The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this.
6829_68771_000012_000004 mr Hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the Elmhurst grounds, and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners.
6829_68771_000043_000000 Beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire. Somehow, she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not she was mistaken in supposing Eliza to be the missing Lucy, she had stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving.
6829_68771_000038_000000 "Excuse me, please.
6829_68771_000036_000000 "Will you excuse my answering that question?" she asked.
6829_68771_000010_000009 The office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year, and this sum Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it.
6829_68771_000012_000003 And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829_68771_000005_000001 mr Hopkins had come to realize that he had "the fight of his life" on his hands, and that defeat meant his political ruin.
6829_68771_000047_000000 "I wish I knew myself," she cried, fiercely.
6829_68771_000011_000001 mr Cummings, who was to profit by the deal, was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter Kenneth Forbes to secure votes for himself.
6829_68771_000003_000000 CHAPTER twelve
6829_68771_000018_000000 The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Chinese and Japanese lanterns, streamers and Forbes banners.
6829_68771_000021_000000 So she greeted the girl cordially, and said:
6829_68771_000015_000000 Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations.
6829_68771_000009_000000 But, to offset this cheering condition, the Democratic agents who made the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the district, and that many of those who declared for Hopkins were lukewarm and faint hearted, and might easily be induced to change their votes. This was what must be prevented.
6829_68771_000019_000000 "We ought to have more attendants, Beth," said Louise, approaching her cousin.
6829_68771_000012_000000 But the Honorable Erastus had no intention of "taking chances," or "monkeying with fate," as he tersely expressed it.
6829_68771_000011_000002 It was thought that this clever arrangement would easily win the fight for Hopkins.
6829_68771_000041_000000 Eliza Parsons shook her head.
6829_68771_000015_000001 The Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce, and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests.
6829_68771_000027_000000 The girl entered, and gave an involuntary cry of surprise.
6829_68771_000023_000002 I'll go and ask her."
6829_68771_000046_000000 A sudden wave of scarlet swept over Eliza's face.
6829_68771_000006_000001 To himself he admitted their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head was managing their affairs.
6829_68771_000010_000008 The only thing necessary was to "fix" Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829_68771_000004_000000 BETH MEETS A REBUFF
6829_68771_000012_000001 Every scheme known to politicians must be worked, and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins.
6829_68771_000042_000002 They-they excite me, in some way, and I-I can't bear them.
6829_68771_000010_000005 Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins.
6829_68771_000040_000001 "I hoped you would be able to assist me on the lawn.
6829_68771_000038_000002 I have a headache."
6829_68771_000045_000000 "I wish," said Beth, slowly, "I knew you."
6829_68771_000022_000003 But she didn't seem very sick to me."
6829_68771_000044_000001 She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
5105_28233_000019_000001 Ben Zoof, however, did not despair of ultimately converting the captain, and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him.
5105_28233_000019_000002 When a private in the eighth Cavalry, he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age, but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to Captain Servadac.
5105_28233_000016_000001 She was a colonel's widow, young and handsome, very reserved, not to say haughty in her manner, and either indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired. Captain Servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment; of rivals he was well aware he had not a few, and amongst these not the least formidable was the Russian Count Timascheff.
5105_28233_000001_000000 CHAPTER two.
5105_28233_000019_000005 The bond of union thus effected could never be severed; and although Ben Zoof's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement, he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer.
5105_28233_000019_000003 Side by side they fought in two campaigns.
5105_28233_000014_000000 And through a storm of shot, not one of which touched the prostrate officer, the troop passed in safety.
5105_28233_000019_000004 Servadac had saved Ben Zoof's life in Japan; Ben Zoof had rendered his master a like service in the Soudan.
5105_28233_000013_000002 They came to a place where the side work of the trench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually fallen in, leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grape shot that was pouring in thick and fast.
5105_28233_000013_000003 The men hesitated.
5105_28233_000022_000000 Ben Zoof's eyes glistened with delight; and from that moment Hector Servadac and Montmartre held equal places in his affection.
5105_28233_000013_000004 In an instant Servadac mounted the side work, laid himself down in the gap, and thus filling up the breach by his own body, shouted, "March on!"
5105_28233_000010_000000 Hector Servadac was thirty years of age, an orphan without lineage and almost without means.
5105_28233_000010_000001 Thirsting for glory rather than for gold, slightly scatter brained, but warm hearted, generous, and brave, he was eminently formed to be the protege of the god of battles.
5105_28233_000018_000002 To crown all, Montmartre boasted a mountain-a veritable mountain; envious tongues indeed might pronounce it little more than a hill; but Ben Zoof would have allowed himself to be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than fifteen thousand feet in height.
5105_28233_000017_000001 Ben Zoof was devoted, body and soul, to his superior officer.
5105_28241_000005_000004 Nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl themselves and rebound against the sides of the vessel; they might rather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner (its weight diminished from the same cause as that of the water) alternately to such heights and depths, that if Captain Servadac had been subject to seasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight.
5105_28241_000016_000000 "Simply this, captain: that since the earth entered her new orbit half the sixty four days has already elapsed, and yet it is only just recently that she has crossed the orbit of Venus, hardly one third of the distance to be traversed to reach the sun"
5105_28241_000003_000001 Her sea going qualities were excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
5105_28241_000006_000000 For a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of Algeria; but no land appeared to the south.
5105_28241_000021_000003 The imperial fort, too, was built upon an elevation of seven hundred fifty feet; it is incredible that it should be so totally submerged. Unless some vestiges of these are found, I shall begin to suspect that the whole of Africa has been swallowed in some vast abyss."
5105_28241_000008_000000 On the first morning of the cruise Lieutenant Procope, who, like most Russians, spoke French fluently, was explaining these peculiarities to Captain Servadac; the count was present, and the conversation perpetually recurred, as naturally it would, to the phenomena which remained so inexplicable to them all.
5105_28241_000020_000000 Captain Servadac, with clenched teeth and knitted brow, stood sternly, almost fiercely, regarding the boundless waste of water.
5105_28241_000002_000000 CHAPTER ten A SEARCH FOR ALGERIA
5105_28241_000015_000000 "And what demonstration do you offer," asked Servadac eagerly, "that it will not happen?"
5105_28241_000021_000002 Surely some portion of the Casbah must still rise above the waves?
5105_28241_000009_000000 "It is very evident," said the lieutenant, "that ever since the first of January the earth has been moving in a new orbit, and from some unknown cause has drawn nearer to the sun"
5105_28241_000004_000004 The late astounding events, however, had rendered Procope manifestly uneasy, and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety.
5105_28241_000025_000001 After pondering awhile, he said: "If we were farther away I should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms.
5105_28241_000017_000000 The lieutenant paused to allow time for reflection, and added: "Moreover, I have every reason to believe that we are not so near the sun as we have been.
5105_28241_000025_000000 The lieutenant shook his head.
5105_28241_000012_000000 "There is no fear of that, sir.
5105_28241_000025_000003 I confess I am puzzled."
5105_28241_000005_000001 With a favorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress.
5105_28241_000012_000001 The earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit, but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun"
5105_28241_000027_000002 Nothing was to be done but to put about, and return in disappointment towards the north.
5105_28241_000017_000002 At the same time, we have the problem still unsolved that the Mediterranean has evidently been transported to the equatorial zone."
5105_28241_000025_000002 Five fathoms!
5105_28241_000011_000000 "And finish up by a collision with the sun!" added the count.
5105_28241_000019_000004 But Algiers, like all the other coast towns, had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.
5105_28241_000022_000002 Perhaps the depths might disclose what the surface failed to reveal, and Count Timascheff, anxious that Servadac should have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts, called for the sounding line.
5105_28241_000020_000002 All the images of his past life floated upon his memory; his thoughts sped away to his native France, only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the Algerian metropolis.
5105_28241_000026_000000 For the next thirty six hours, until the fourth of February, the sea was examined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance.
5105_28241_000005_000002 Although only a moderate breeze was blowing, the sea was rough, a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant, that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented.
5105_28241_000005_000000 Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.
5105_28241_000007_000000 Happily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass; the magnetic needle, which in these regions had pointed about twenty two degrees from the north pole, had never deviated in the least-a proof that, although east and west had apparently changed places, north and south continued to retain their normal position as cardinal points.
5105_28241_000024_000000 "You must see, lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined."
5105_28241_000014_000000 "I can, sir.
5105_28241_000013_000000 "Can you satisfy us of that?" asked the count.
5105_28241_000010_000000 "No doubt about that," said Servadac; "and I suppose that, having crossed the orbit of Venus, we have a good chance of running into the orbit of Mercury."
5105_28241_000004_000001 The lieutenant was well informed in many matters outside the pale of his profession, and his attainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend who had given him his education.
5105_28241_000021_000000 "Is it not impossible," he murmured aloud, "that any city should disappear so completely?
5105_28241_000003_000004 After an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy, and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht, in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time, throughout the winter generally cruising in the Mediterranean, whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.
5105_28241_000022_000001 Not a material object of any kind was to be noticed floating on the surface of the water; not one branch of a tree had been seen drifting by, nor one spar belonging to one of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored in the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from Cape Matafuz to Point Pexade.
5105_28241_000004_000000 The ship could not have been in better hands.
5105_28241_000021_000001 Would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible?
5105_28241_000022_000000 Another circumstance was most remarkable.
5105_28241_000014_000001 I can give you a proof which I think you will own is conclusive.
5105_28241_000003_000002 Count Timascheff was himself no sailor, but had the greatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of Lieutenant Procope, a man of about thirty years of age, and an excellent seaman.
5105_28241_000020_000001 His pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city.
5105_28241_000018_000000 Both the count and the captain expressed themselves reassured by his representations, and observed that they must now do all in their power to discover what had become of the vast continent of Africa, of which, they were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige.
5105_28241_000026_000001 Its depth remained invariable, still four, or at most five, fathoms; and although its bottom was assiduously dredged, it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type.
5105_28240_000013_000005 Captain Servadac hastened towards him.
5105_28240_000017_000000 "I am quite aware of it.
5105_28240_000013_000002 After rounding the peak, she steered direct for the channel to which Servadac by his gestures was pointing her, and was not long in entering the creek.
5105_28240_000030_000000 The count shook his head.
5105_28240_000031_000000 "I am not sure," said he, "but what the tour of the Mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world."
5105_28240_000024_000005 Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification? To all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative.
5105_28240_000003_000000 CHAPTER nine.
3729_6852_000066_000001 The 'badauds', who never fail to congregate near the carriage of princes, no matter if they have seen them a hundred times, or if they know them to be as ugly as monkeys, repeated the words of the duchess everywhere, and that was enough to send here all the snuff takers of the capital in a hurry.
3729_6852_000039_000000 "The milk is very good."
3729_6852_000004_000003 In order to please her, I spoke to her of the Abbe Conti, and I had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer.
3729_6852_000082_000002 I have the best Italian poets.
3729_6852_000041_000000 "Without milk!
3729_6852_000037_000000 "Excellent, I made it myself yesterday."
3729_6852_000078_000003 I thanked him, but I was not deceived by his compliment.
3729_6852_000028_000000 "Here, go and get me change for a Louis."
3729_6852_000035_000001 After his visit I told Esprit to take me to the Palais Royal, and I left him at the gates.
3729_6852_000068_000004 Therefore it is not a paradox to say that the French would be wiser if they were less witty.
3729_6852_000041_000001 Well, sir, we never make coffee but in the afternoon. Would you like a good bavaroise, or a decanter of orgeat?"
3729_6852_000026_000000 "Well!
3729_6852_000026_000001 I shall call you Esprit."
3729_6852_000003_000004 Martelli composed a satire against Maffei, in which he designated him by the anagram of Femia.
3729_6852_000008_000001 She held her tongue, but from that time she told everybody that I was an impostor.
3729_6852_000040_000002 Make me a cup of fresh coffee without milk."
3729_6852_000049_000000 My new friend was a poet as I was; he was an admirer of Italian literature, while I admired the French.
3729_6852_000081_000001 But, sir, how shall I find a teacher?
3729_6852_000044_000000 "You are mad, she has given birth to a princess."
3729_6852_000003_000001 Baletti's father, who had just recovered from a long illness, was not with us, but we had his father's sister, who was older than Mario.
3729_6852_000084_000003 The expression of Crebillon's face was that of the lion's or of the cat's, which is the same thing.
3729_6852_000042_000000 "Yes, give me the orgeat."
3729_6852_000040_000000 "Milk!
3729_6852_000040_000001 I never drink any.
3729_6852_000068_000000 "Quite the reverse, for it was a cunning artifice on her part.
3729_6852_000029_000000 "I have it, sir."
3729_6852_000055_000000 I laugh heartily.
3729_6852_000048_000001 I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
3729_6852_000048_000003 My remark pleases him, but I soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak, however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer.
2961_961_000019_000007 Other periods of wonderful length and complexity are not observed by men in general; there is moreover a cycle or perfect year at the completion of which they all meet and coincide...To this end the stars came into being, that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature.
2961_961_000020_000003 The gods were made in the form of a circle, which is the most perfect figure and the figure of the universe. They were created chiefly of fire, that they might be bright, and were made to know and follow the best, and to be scattered over the heavens, of which they were to be the glory.
2961_961_000022_000004 Do ye therefore make them; I will implant in them the seed of immortality, and you shall weave together the mortal and immortal, and provide food for them, and receive them again in death.' Thus he spake, and poured the remains of the elements into the cup in which he had mingled the soul of the universe.
2961_961_000018_000000 When the Father who begat the world saw the image which he had made of the Eternal Gods moving and living, he rejoiced; and in his joy resolved, since the archetype was eternal, to make the creature eternal as far as this was possible.
2961_961_000013_000003 All that he did was done rationally in and by himself, and he moved in a circle turning within himself, which is the most intellectual of motions; but the other six motions were wanting to him; wherefore the universe had no feet or legs.
2961_961_000013_000000 and so put together a visible and palpable heaven, having harmony and friendship in the union of the four elements; and being at unity with itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer.
2961_961_000016_000003 The entire compound was divided by him lengthways into two parts, which he united at the centre like the letter X, and bent into an inner and outer circle or sphere, cutting one another again at a point over against the point at which they cross.
2961_961_000004_000024 The memory of them was lost, because there was no written voice among you.
2961_961_000018_000001 Wherefore he made an image of eternity which is time, having an uniform motion according to number, parted into months and days and years, and also having greater divisions of past, present, and future.
2961_961_000020_000000 Thus far the universal animal was made in the divine image, but the other animals were not as yet included in him.
2961_961_000004_000027 Nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours, and eight thousand since she founded ours, as our annals record.
2961_961_000023_000001 And his children, receiving from him the immortal principle, borrowed from the world portions of earth, air, fire, water, hereafter to be returned, which they fastened together, not with the adamantine bonds which bound themselves, but by little invisible pegs, making each separate body out of all the elements, subject to influx and efflux, and containing the courses of the soul.
2961_961_000007_000001 Is the world created or uncreated?--that is the first question.
2961_961_000004_000039 A little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods, and your warrior race all sank into the earth; and the great island of Atlantis also disappeared in the sea.
2961_961_000021_000001 Although they give no proof, we must believe them as is customary.
2961_961_000019_000000 Thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature; and it was created together with the heavens, in order that if they were dissolved, it might perish with them.
2961_961_000008_000000 SOCRATES: Excellent, Timaeus, I like your manner of approaching the subject-proceed.
2961_961_000004_000006 The old man brightened up at hearing this, and said: Had Solon only had the leisure which was required to complete the famous legend which he brought with him from Egypt he would have been as distinguished as Homer and Hesiod.
2961_961_000011_000001 For if in the original there had been more than one they would have been the parts of a third, which would have been the true pattern of the world; and therefore there is, and will ever be, but one created world.
2961_961_000023_000007 And when external impressions enter in, they are really conquered, though they seem to conquer.
2961_961_000020_000004 Two kinds of motion were assigned to them-first, the revolution in the same and around the same, in peaceful unchanging thought of the same; and to this was added a forward motion which was under the control of the same.
2961_961_000019_000002 He put the moon in the orbit which was nearest to the earth, the sun in that next, the morning star and Mercury in the orbits which move opposite to the sun but with equal swiftness-this being the reason why they overtake and are overtaken by one another.
2961_961_000004_000019 Now the Nile is our saviour from fire, and as there is little rain in Egypt, we are not harmed by water; whereas in other countries, when a deluge comes, the inhabitants are swept by the rivers into the sea.
2961_961_000002_000001 He lightly touches upon a few points,--the division of labour and distribution of the citizens into classes, the double nature and training of the guardians, the community of property and of women and children.
2961_961_000004_000017 For there occurs at long intervals a derangement of the heavenly bodies, and then the earth is destroyed by fire.
2961_961_000022_000001 That which is bound may be dissolved, but only an evil being would dissolve that which is harmonious and happy.
2961_961_000022_000002 And although you are not immortal you shall not die, for I will hold you together.
2961_961_000020_000001 And God created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original.
2961_961_000004_000021 But in Egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples.
2961_961_000009_000000 TIMAEUS: Why did the Creator make the world?...He was good, and therefore not jealous, and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should be like himself.
2961_961_000011_000002 Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and tangible,--visible and therefore made of fire,--tangible and therefore solid and made of earth.
2961_961_000002_000000 Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic.
2961_961_000022_000005 They were no longer pure as before, but diluted; and the mixture he distributed into souls equal in number to the stars, and assigned each to a star-then having mounted them, as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the universe, and told them of their future birth and human lot.
2961_961_000017_000001 The body of heaven is visible, but the soul is invisible, and partakes of reason and harmony, and is the best of creations, being the work of the best.
2961_961_000004_000036 This mighty power was arrayed against Egypt and Hellas and all the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.
2961_961_000023_000002 These swelling and surging as in a river moved irregularly and irrationally in all the six possible ways, forwards, backwards, right, left, up and down.
2961_961_000024_000000 By reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence, but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates, and the courses of the soul regain their proper motion, and apprehend the same and the other rightly, and become rational.
2961_961_000026_000003 Sight is the source of the greatest benefits to us; for if our eyes had never seen the sun, stars, and heavens, the words which we have spoken would not have been uttered.
2961_961_000025_000000 The two divine courses were encased by the gods in a sphere which is called the head, and is the god and lord of us.
2961_961_000014_000000 And so the thought of God made a God in the image of a perfect body, having intercourse with himself and needing no other, but in every part harmonious and self-contained and truly blessed.
2961_961_000014_000002 God took of the unchangeable and indivisible and also of the divisible and corporeal, and out of the two he made a third nature, essence, which was in a mean between them, and partook of the same and the other, the intractable nature of the other being compressed into the same.
2961_961_000011_000004 And as the world was composed of solids, between the elements of fire and earth God placed two other elements of air and water, and arranged them in a continuous proportion-
2961_961_000023_000006 And something similar happens when the disordered motions of the soul come into contact with any external thing; they say the same or the other in a manner which is the very opposite of the truth, and they are false and foolish, and have no guiding principle in them.
2961_961_000014_000003 Having made a compound of all the three, he proceeded to divide the entire mass into portions related to one another in the ratios of one, two, three, four, nine, eight, twenty seven, and proceeded to fill up the double and triple intervals thus-
2961_961_000025_000003 They first contrived the eyes, into which they conveyed a light akin to the light of day, making it flow through the pupils.
2961_961_000026_000002 Of the second or concurrent causes of sight I have already spoken, and I will now speak of the higher purpose of God in giving us eyes.
2961_961_000004_000033 And there you dwelt as became the children of the gods, excelling all men in virtue, and many famous actions are recorded of you.
2961_961_000019_000004 And since this was controlled by the movement of the same, the seven planets in their courses appeared to describe spirals; and that appeared fastest which was slowest, and that which overtook others appeared to be overtaken by them.
2961_961_000025_000006 The fire or light, when kept in by the eyelids, equalizes the inward motions, and there is rest accompanied by few dreams; only when the greater motions remain they engender in us corresponding visions of the night.
2961_961_000016_000004 The outer circle or sphere was named the sphere of the same-the inner, the sphere of the other or diverse; and the one revolved horizontally to the right, the other diagonally to the left.
2961_961_000004_000012 Perceiving this, and with the view of eliciting information from them, he told them the tales of Phoroneus and Niobe, and also of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and he endeavoured to count the generations which had since passed.
2961_961_000004_000008 The subject was a very noble one; he described the most famous action in which the Athenian people were ever engaged.
2961_961_000026_000004 The sight of them and their revolutions has given us the knowledge of number and time, the power of enquiry, and philosophy, which is the great blessing of human life; not to speak of the lesser benefits which even the vulgar can appreciate.
2961_961_000024_000002 This, however, is an after stage-at present, we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul.
2961_961_000020_000006 The earth, which is our nurse, clinging around the pole extended through the universe, he made to be the guardian and artificer of night and day, first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven.
2961_961_000023_000003 But violent as were the internal and alimentary fluids, the tide became still more violent when the body came into contact with flaming fire, or the solid earth, or gliding waters, or the stormy wind; the motions produced by these impulses pass through the body to the soul and have the name of sensations.
2961_961_000004_000003 The occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the Apaturia called the Registration of Youth, at which our parents gave prizes for recitation.
2961_961_000022_000003 Hear me, then:--Three tribes of mortal beings have still to be created, but if created by me they would be like gods.
2961_961_000004_000032 The spot of earth which the goddess chose had the best of climates, and produced the wisest men; in no other was she herself, the philosopher and warrior goddess, so likely to have votaries.
2961_961_000011_000000 Are there many worlds or one only?--that is the fourth question...One only.
2961_961_000020_000007 Vain would be the labour of telling all the figures of them, moving as in dance, and their juxta positions and approximations, and when and where and behind what other stars they appear to disappear-to tell of all this without looking at a plan of them would be labour in vain.
2961_961_000019_000003 All these bodies became living creatures, and learnt their appointed tasks, and began to move, the nearer more swiftly, the remoter more slowly, according to the diagonal movement of the other.
2961_961_000005_000004 'I see,' replied Socrates, 'that I shall be well entertained; and do you, Timaeus, offer up a prayer and begin.'
2961_961_000024_000001 The soul of him who has education is whole and perfect and escapes the worst disease, but, if a man's education be neglected, he walks lamely through life and returns good for nothing to the world below.
2961_961_000020_000002 There are four of them: one of gods, another of birds, a third of fishes, and a fourth of animals.
2961_961_000004_000029 I will briefly describe them to you, and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers.
2961_961_000014_000001 The soul was first made by him-the elder to rule the younger; not in the order in which our wayward fancy has led us to describe them, but the soul first and afterwards the body.
2961_961_000011_000003 But two terms must be united by a third, which is a mean between them; and had the earth been a surface only, one mean would have sufficed, but two means are required to unite solid bodies.
2961_961_000022_000007 The souls were to be implanted in bodies, which were in a perpetual flux, whence, he said, would arise, first, sensation; secondly, love, which is a mixture of pleasure and pain; thirdly, fear and anger, and the opposite affections: and if they conquered these, they would live righteously, but if they were conquered by them, unrighteously.
2961_961_000010_000000 In the likeness of what animal was the world made?--that is the third question...The form of the perfect animal was a whole, and contained all intelligible beings, and the visible animal, made after the pattern of this, included all visible creatures.
2961_961_000005_000001 But I would not speak at the time, because I wanted to refresh my memory. I had heard the old man when I was a child, and though I could not remember the whole of our yesterday's discourse, I was able to recall every word of this, which is branded into my mind; and I am prepared, Socrates, to rehearse to you the entire narrative.
2961_961_000004_000037 Then your city did bravely, and won renown over the whole earth.
2961_961_000019_000006 Thus arose day and night, which are the periods of the most intelligent nature; a month is created by the revolution of the moon, a year by that of the sun
2961_961_000004_000035 This great island lay over against the Pillars of Heracles, in extent greater than Libya and Asia put together, and was the passage to other islands and to a great ocean of which the Mediterranean sea was only the harbour; and within the Pillars the empire of Atlantis reached in Europe to Tyrrhenia and in Libya to Egypt.
2961_961_000004_000014 'In mind,' replied the priest, 'I mean to say that you are children; there is no opinion or tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age; and I will tell you why.
2961_961_000003_000001 But he is unable to invent such a narrative himself; and he is afraid that the poets are equally incapable; for, although he pretends to have nothing to say against them, he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators, who can only describe what they have seen.
2961_961_000025_000005 But when the visual ray goes forth into the darkness, then unlike falls upon unlike-the eye no longer sees, and we go to sleep.
2961_961_000004_000007 'And what was the subject of the poem?' said the person who made the remark.
2961_961_000007_000004 What is spoken of the unchanging or intelligible must be certain and true; but what is spoken of the created image can only be probable; being is to becoming what truth is to belief.
2961_961_000019_000005 And God lighted a fire in the second orbit from the earth which is called the sun, to give light over the whole heaven, and to teach intelligent beings that knowledge of number which is derived from the revolution of the same.
2961_961_000025_000008 The fires from within and from without meet about the smooth and bright surface of the mirror; and because they meet in a manner contrary to the usual mode, the right and left sides of the object are transposed.
2961_961_000009_000002 Now he who is the best could only create the fairest; and reflecting that of visible things the intelligent is superior to the unintelligent, he put intelligence in soul and soul in body, and framed the universe to be the best and fairest work in the order of nature, and the world became a living soul through the providence of God.
2961_961_000004_000002 Critias when he told this tale of the olden time, was ninety years old, I being not more than ten.
2961_961_000022_000000 When all of them, both those who show themselves in the sky, and those who retire from view, had come into being, the Creator addressed them thus:--'Gods, sons of gods, my works, if I will, are indissoluble.
2961_961_000004_000034 The most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of Atlantis.
2961_961_000026_000005 God gave us the faculty of sight that we might behold the order of the heavens and create a corresponding order in our own erring minds.
2300_131720_000019_000002 The arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises, or in a circuit for public street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in the month; and was paid for at that rate, subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident.
2300_131720_000022_000003 There was an average cost per lamp for meter operation of twenty two cents a year, and each meter took care of an average of seventeen lamps.
2300_131720_000005_000005 Its thin wires can be carried cheaply over vast areas, and at each local point of consumption the transformer of size exactly proportioned to its local task takes the high voltage transmission current and lowers its potential at a ratio of twenty or forty to one, for use in distribution and consumption circuits.
2300_131720_000018_000002 They were later used as reserve machines, and finally, with the engine, retired from service as part of the "Collection of Edisonia"; but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three.
2300_131720_000042_000004 For a six hour run of the plant one quarter of a cord of wood was required, at a cost of twenty five cents per cord.
2300_131720_000010_000004 The invention is in universal use today, alike for direct and for alternating current, and as well in the equipment of large buildings as in the distribution system of the most extensive central station networks.
2300_131720_000008_000004 I took it up, and it had solved the engine oiling problem-and my walk to Lawrence like a tramp actor's was off!
2300_131720_000044_000001 The most interesting feature of this installation was the employment of special deep-sea lamps, supplied with current through a cable nine hundred and forty feet in length, for the purpose of alluring fish.
2300_131720_000038_000000 Thus the art was set going in the United States under many difficulties, but with every sign of coming triumph.
2300_131720_000034_000001 He had been connected with local telephone interests, but resigned to take active charge of this plant, imbibing quickly the traditional Edison spirit, working hard all day and sleeping in the station at night on a cot brought there for that purpose.
2300_131720_000015_000003 Meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system, known in England as the Hopkinson, both dr john Hopkinson and mr Edison being independent inventors at practically the same time.
2300_131720_000024_000003 He felt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better.
2300_131720_000030_000005 I telephoned again, and felt something would happen, but fortunately it did not.
2300_131720_000020_000007 His electrolytic meter was very successful, and was of widespread use in America and in Europe until the perfection of mechanical meters by Elihu Thomson and others brought that type into general acceptance.
2300_131720_000026_000004 I made him a personal guarantee, that if he would take hold of the station and put it on a commercial basis, and pay five per cent. on six hundred thousand dollars, I would give him ten thousand dollars out of my own pocket.
2300_131720_000038_000002 The first permanent Edison station in Europe was that at Milan, Italy, for which the order was given as early as May, eighteen eighty two, by an enterprising syndicate.
2300_131720_000039_000007 We had two wire underground feeders, sent without any plans or specifications for their installation.
2300_131720_000004_000000 Edison was from the first deeply impressed with the possibilities of water power, and, as this incident shows, was prompt to seize such a very early opportunity.
2300_131720_000004_000001 But his attention was in reality concentrated closely on the supply of great centres of population, a task which he then felt might well occupy his lifetime; and except in regard to furnishing isolated plants he did not pursue further the development of hydro-electric stations.
2300_131720_000019_000001 At this time and long after, all arc lighting was done on a "flat rate" basis.
2300_131720_000008_000005 The eccentric strap had a round glass oil cup with a brass base that screwed into the strap.
2300_131720_000035_000001 We then went to the dynamo room, where I pointed out the machines converting the steam power into electricity, appearing later in the form of light in the lamps.
2300_131720_000016_000006 mr Andrews and I worked in collaboration until the night of the third.
2300_131720_000003_000000 As a matter of fact the first Edison commercial station to be operated in this country was that at appleton wisconsin, but its only serious claim to notice is that it was the initial one of the system driven by water power.
2300_131720_000032_000005 The investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground.
2300_131720_000008_000008 He did so.
2300_131720_000019_000000 Sunbury was also provided with the first electro chemical meters used in the United States outside New York City, so that it served also to accentuate electrical practice in a most vital respect-namely, the measurement of the electrical energy supplied to customers.
2300_131720_000037_000001 The Jury of Awards, in presenting four medals to the Edison company, took occasion to pay a high compliment to the efficiency of the system.
2300_131720_000004_000006 Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300_131720_000002_000001 The Paris plant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit.
2300_131720_000007_000001 He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake; also regulator of speed; but waited for an indicator to verify it.
2300_131720_000034_000002 It was a time of uninterrupted watchfulness.
2300_131720_000006_000005 Not a single engine was even within gunshot of the standard thus set up, but the emergency called forth its man in Gardiner c Sims, a talented draughtsman and designer who had been engaged in locomotive construction and in the engineering department of the United States Navy.
2300_131720_000034_000008 mr Sprague realized the trouble, quickly threw off the current and stopped the engine.
2300_131720_000016_000002 About that time mr Andrews and I came together.
2300_131720_000039_000005 With those eight dynamos we had four belts between each engine and the dynamo.
2300_131720_000003_000001 It went into service august fifteenth eighteen eighty two, about three weeks before the Pearl Street station.
2300_131720_000042_000003 The boilers were fired by wood, as the economical transportation of coal was a physical impossibility.
2300_131720_000012_000001 Desiring to put this new system into practical use promptly, and receiving applications for licenses from all over the country, Edison selected brockton massachusetts, and Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as the two towns for the trial.
2300_131720_000023_000000 In this connection it should be mentioned that the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate, and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights; and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter.
2300_131720_000019_000004 Few of these data were ever actually used, however; and it was all more or less a matter of guesswork, although the central station manager, aiming to give good service, would naturally see that the dynamos were so operated as to maintain as steadily as possible the normal potential and current.
2300_131720_000016_000005 Having travelled around the world, I had cultivated an indifference to any special difficulties of that kind.
2300_131720_000006_000004 He did not want his customers to count the heart beats of the engine in the flicker of the lamp.
2300_131720_000003_000003 The dynamo electric machine, though small, was robust, for under all the varying speeds of water power, and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it, belonged, it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine--seventeen years.
2300_131720_000005_000006 This evolution has been quite distinct, with its own inventors like Gaulard and Gibbs and Stanley, but came subsequent to the work of supplying small, dense areas of population; the art thus growing from within, and using each new gain as a means for further achievement.
2300_131720_000039_000003 We had no means of boring out the field magnets, and we cut grooves in them. I think the machine is still running (nineteen o seven).
2300_131720_000021_000006 The standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination, another set being substituted. The meter was cheap to manufacture and install, and not at all liable to get out of order.
2300_131720_000027_000004 Of course the nights were getting longer.
2300_131720_000042_000001 The hotel is situated at an elevation of thirty five hundred feet above the sea, and was at that time forty miles from the railroad.
2300_131720_000041_000002 The first mill plant was placed in the woollen factory of james Harrison at Newburgh, New York, about september fifteenth eighteen eighty one.
2300_131720_000042_000002 The machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain.
2300_131720_000026_000003 I knew Chinnock to be square and of good business ability, and induced him to leave his job.
2300_131720_000025_000005 To prevent these electrolytes from freezing we had in each meter a strip of metal.
2300_131720_000037_000002 It has been thought by many that the magnificent success of this plant did more to stimulate the growth of the incandescent lighting business than any other event in the history of the Edison company.
2300_131720_000034_000003 The difficulty of obtaining engineers in those days to run the high-speed engines (three hundred and fifty revolutions per minute) is well illustrated by an amusing incident in the very early history of the station.
2300_131720_000027_000006 Then the man called Chinnock up.
2300_131720_000035_000003 They appeared to be interested, and I proceeded to enter upon a comparison of coal made into gas or burned under a boiler to be converted into electricity.
2300_131720_000017_000001 The organization was crude, the steam engineering talent poor, and owing to the impossibility of getting any considerable capital subscribed, the plants were put in as cheaply as possible.
2300_131720_000033_000003 Soon after the station went into operation this ingenious plan was changed, and the third dynamo was replaced by two others.
2300_131720_000018_000001 Nothing happened, however, to interfere with the successful running of the station, and for twenty years thereafter the same two dynamos continued to furnish light in Sunbury.
2300_131720_000004_000002 That was left to others, and to the application of the alternating current, which has enabled engineers to harness remote powers, and, within thoroughly economical limits, transmit thousands of horse power as much as two hundred miles at pressures of eighty thousand and one hundred thousand volts.
2300_131720_000038_000006 This new plant takes high tension polyphase current from a water power thirty or forty miles away at Paderno, on the river Adda, flowing from the Apennines; but delivers low tension direct current for distribution to the regular Edison three wire system throughout Milan.
2300_131720_000026_000001 We started to collect some bills; but we found that our books were kept badly, and that the person in charge, who was no business man, had neglected that part of it.
2300_131720_000004_000003 Owing to his insistence on low pressure, direct current for use in densely populated districts, as the only safe and truly universal, profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers, Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current.
2300_131720_000012_000002 Of these two Brockton required the larger plant, but with the conductors placed underground. It was the first to complete its arrangements and close its contract. mr Henry Villard, it will be remembered, had married the daughter of Garrison, the famous abolitionist, and it was through his relationship with the Garrison family that Brockton came to have the honor of exemplifying so soon the principles of an entirely new art.
2300_131720_000041_000001 Note has already been made of the first Edison plants afloat on the Jeannette and Columbia, and the first commercial plant in the New York lithographic establishment.
2300_131720_000004_000011 Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture.
2300_131720_000024_000004 Once again he went to the customer's meter to look around, when a small piece of thick wire on the floor caught his eye. The problem was solved.
2300_131720_000037_000003 It was literally the beginning of the electrical illumination of American Expositions, carried later to such splendid displays as those of the Chicago World's Fair in eighteen ninety three, Buffalo in nineteen o one, and saint Louis in nineteen o four.
2300_131720_000008_000007 I requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base I had.
2300_131720_000005_000003 It could not be used for electroplating or deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current.
2300_131720_000008_000003 It had been stepped on and flattened.
2300_131720_000033_000005 Some idea of the confidence inspired by the fame of Edison at this period is shown by the fact that the first theatre ever lighted from a central station by incandescent lamps was designed this year, and opened in eighteen eighty four at Brockton with an equipment of three hundred lamps.
2300_131720_000019_000003 The early arc lamps were rated to require nine to ten amperes of current, at forty five volts pressure each, receiving which they were estimated to give two thousand c.p., which was arrived at by adding together the light found at four different positions, so that in reality the actual light was about five hundred c.p.
2300_131720_000006_000002 Copper for the circuits was more highly refined than ever before to secure the best conductivity, and purity was insisted on in every kind of insulation. Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer.
2300_131720_000033_000006 The theatre was never piped for gas! It was also from the Brockton central station that current was first supplied to a fire engine house-another display of remarkably early belief in the trustworthiness of the service, under conditions where continuity of lighting was vital.
2300_131720_000016_000004 The electrical work had to be done in forty eight hours!
2300_131720_000018_000000 On july fourth the Sunbury plant was put into commercial operation by Edison, and he remained a week studying its conditions and watching for any unforeseen difficulty that might arise.
2300_131720_000012_000000 The strong position held by the Edison system, under the strenuous competition that was already springing up, was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system; and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting.
2300_131720_000004_000004 This does him an injustice.
2300_131720_000026_000000 "After the station had been running several months and was technically a success, we began to look after the financial part.
2300_131720_000006_000001 Every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree.
2300_131720_000017_000002 I believe that this construction department was unkindly named the 'Destruction Department.' It served its purpose; never made any money; and I had the unpleasant task of presiding at its obsequies."
2300_131720_000039_000008 The station had neither voltmeter nor ammeter.
2300_131720_000030_000003 A sudden black cloud came up, and I telephoned to Chinnock and asked him about the load.
2300_131720_000040_000002 A model of this station is preserved in the Deutschen Museum at Munich.
2300_131720_000016_000014 But the plant ran, and it was the first three wire station in this country."
2300_131720_000020_000006 Edison, however, had satisfied himself that there were various ways of accomplishing the task, and had determined that the current should be measured on the premises of every consumer.
2300_131720_000025_000007 The heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing, so that the meter could go on doing its duty.
2300_131720_000013_000002 One ammeter, for measuring the quantity of current output, was interpolated in the "neutral bus" or third wire return circuit to indicate when the load on the two machines was out of balance.
2300_131720_000020_000003 Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter.
2300_131720_000033_000000 The station equipment at Brockton consisted at first of three dynamos, one of which was so arranged as to supply both sides of the system during light loads by a breakdown switch connection.
2300_131720_000033_000008 It was at this central station that Lieutenant Sprague began his historic work on the electric motor; and here that another distinguished engineer and inventor, mr h Ward Leonard, installed the meters and became meter man, in order that he might study in every intimate detail the improvements and refinements necessary in that branch of the industry.
2300_131720_000026_000002 In fact, he did not know anything about the station, anyway. So I got the directors to permit me to hire a man to run the station. This was mr Chinnock, who was then superintendent of the Metropolitan Telephone Company of New York.
2300_131720_000040_000004 The International Electrical Exposition at Paris was intended to place before the eyes of the civilized world the achievements of the century.
2300_131720_000040_000005 Among the exhibits of that Exposition was the Edison system of incandescent lighting.
2300_131720_000039_000010 We were using coal costing twelve dollars a ton, and were paid for our light in currency worth fifty cents on the dollar.
2300_131720_000032_000000 Returning to the more specific subject of pioneer plants of importance, that at Brockton must be considered for a moment, chiefly for the reason that the city was the first in the world to possess an Edison station distributing current through an underground three wire network of conductors-the essentially modern contemporaneous practice, standard twenty five years later.
2300_131720_000030_000000 "In the second year we put the Stock Exchange on the circuits of the station, but were very fearful that there would be a combination of heavy demand and a dark day, and that there would be an overloaded station.
2300_131720_000005_000002 For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits, and that reason was often urged against it seriously.
2300_131720_000032_000004 Brockton had a good deal of pride in its fine trees, and a strong sentiment was very soon aroused against the mutilation proposed so thoughtlessly.
2300_131720_000025_000002 We put many customers on, but did not make out many bills.
2300_131720_000002_000003 There Messrs. Johnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art, and secured much useful data for the work in New York, of which the story has just been told.
2300_131720_000020_000002 This may answer, perhaps, in a small place where the manager can gauge pretty closely from actual observation what each customer does; but even then there are elements of risk and waste; and obviously in a large city such a method would soon be likely to result in financial disaster to the plant.
2300_131720_000016_000012 They found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings, and there followed remarks which would not look well in print.
2300_131720_000035_000002 After that they were shown the meters by which the consumption of current was measured.
2300_131720_000002_000002 The London plant was less temporary, but not permanent, supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels, churches, stores, and dwellings in the vicinity of Holborn Viaduct.
2300_131720_000043_000001 The installation of boilers, engines, dynamos, wiring, switches, fixtures, three stage regulators, and six hundred and fifty lamps, was completed in eleven days after receipt of the order, and the plant was successfully operated at the opening of the theatre, on december twelfth eighteen eighty two.
2300_131720_000025_000006 When it got very cold the metal would contract and close a circuit, and throw a lamp into circuit inside the meter.
2300_131720_000016_000008 I said we were sent over to get going, and insisted on starting up on the night of the third.
2300_131720_000008_000009 I then had a standard made to hold another oil cup, so as to see and regulate the drop feed.
2300_131720_000038_000005 This pioneer system was operated continuously until february ninth nineteen hundred, or for a period of about seventeen years, when the sturdy old machines, still in excellent condition, were put out of service, so that a larger plant could be installed to meet the demand.
2300_131720_000042_000000 The first Edison plant in a hotel was started in October, eighteen eighty one, at the Blue Mountain House in the Adirondacks, and consisted of two "Z" dynamos with a complement of eight and sixteen candle lamps.
2300_131720_000024_000002 He weighed and reweighed the meter plates, and pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain.
2300_131720_000016_000013 Andrews skipped from under; he obeyed orders; I did not.
2300_131720_000040_000001 The station at Berlin comprised five boilers, and six vertical steam engines driving by belts twelve Edison dynamos, each of about fifty five horse power capacity.
2300_131720_000038_000001 Reference has already been made to the work abroad in Paris and London.
2300_131720_000004_000012 Burbank and his tribe represent in the vegetable world, Edison in the mechanical.
2300_131720_000021_000001 When the lights or motors in the circuit are turned on, and a certain definite small portion of the current is diverted to flow through the meter, from the positive plate to the negative plate, the latter increases in weight by receiving a deposit of metallic zinc; the positive plate meantime losing in weight by the metal thus carried away from it.
2300_131720_000005_000001 When the alternating current was introduced for practical purposes it was not needed for arc lighting, the circuit for which, from a single dynamo, would often be twenty or thirty miles in length, its current having a pressure of not less than five or six thousand volts.
2300_131720_000026_000006 I might remark in this connection that years afterward I applied to the Edison Electric Light Company asking them if they would not like to pay me this money, as it was spent when I was very hard up and made the company a success, and was the foundation of their present prosperity.
2300_131720_000034_000005 One evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering, sizzling noise.
2300_131720_000003_000002 It consisted of one small dynamo of a capacity of two hundred and eighty lights of ten c.p. each, and was housed in an unpretentious wooden shed.
2300_131720_000013_000000 The Sunbury generating plant consisted of an Armington and Sims engine driving two small Edison dynamos having a total capacity of about four hundred lamps of sixteen c.p.
2300_131720_000016_000009 We had an Armington and Sims engine with sight feed oiler.
2300_131720_000025_000008 The first cold day after starting the station, people began to come in from their offices, especially down in Front Street and Water Street, saying the meter was on fire.
2300_131720_000040_000006 IT BECAME THE BASIS OF MODERN HEAVY CURRENT TECHNICS." The last phrase is italicized as being a happy and authoritative description, as well as a tribute.
2300_131720_000020_000008 Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
2300_131720_000033_000004 The Edison construction department took entire charge of the installation of the plant, and the formal opening was attended on october first eighteen eighty three, by mr Edison, who then remained a week in ceaseless study and consultation over the conditions developed by this initial three wire underground plant.
2300_131720_000013_000007 The street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction, and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations. A special type of street pole had been devised by him for the three wire system.
2300_131720_000026_000007 They said they 'were sorry'--that is, 'Wall Street sorry'--and refused to pay it.
2300_131720_000020_000001 It is true that even down to the present time the flat rate is applied to a great deal of incandescent lighting, each lamp being charged for individually according to its probable consumption during each month.
2300_131720_000008_000001 We were at the machine works, Goerck Street.
2300_131720_000016_000010 I had never seen one, and did not know how it worked, with the result that we soon burned up the babbitt metal in the bearings and spent a good part of the night getting them in order.
2300_131720_000030_000001 We had an index like a steam gauge, called an ampere meter, to indicate the amount of current going out.
2300_131720_000035_000004 The ladies thanked me effusively and brought their visit to a close.
2300_131720_000007_000000 "Our first engine compelled the inventing and making of a suitable engine indicator to indicate it-the Tabor.
2300_131720_000033_000001 This arrangement interfered with correct meter registration, as the meters on one side of the system registered backward during the hours in which the combination was employed.
2300_131720_000023_000003 The meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine, and probably up to the close of the century.
2300_131720_000004_000007 By digging a cheap trench and putting in an insulated cable, and connecting such station with the central part of Richmond, having the end of the cable come up into the station from the earth and there connected with motors, the power of the falls would be transmitted to these motors.
2300_131720_000028_000001 No, sir.
1089_134686_000028_000007 Beware of making that mistake.
1089_134686_000014_000002 If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight.
1089_134686_000024_000004 How comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land?
1089_134686_000025_000001 Here he is!
1089_134686_000009_000007 Devotion had gone by the board.
1089_134686_000028_000008 I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.
1089_134686_000014_000001 Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
1089_134686_000026_000000 A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house.
1089_134686_000003_000000 --Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?
1089_134686_000019_000000 A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:
1089_134686_000007_000002 The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward.
1089_134686_000035_000000 He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes.
1089_134686_000028_000001 The retreat will go on from Wednesday to Friday.
1089_134686_000006_000000 --Good night, husband!
1089_134686_000032_000007 It is said that his right arm had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptized. He wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on the island of Sancian.
1089_134686_000029_000000 --I sir?
1089_134686_000015_000000 That was strange.
1089_134686_000032_000004 He is called, as you know, the apostle of the Indies.
1089_134686_000028_000004 Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and general communion for the whole college.
1089_134686_000009_000006 At most, by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace.
1089_134686_000032_000000 --You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college.
1089_134686_000008_000000 The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.
1089_134686_000007_000004 The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
1089_134686_000002_000001 After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels.
1089_134686_000009_000005 His days and works and thoughts could make no atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul.
1089_134686_000015_000004 Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly.
1089_134686_000022_000001 Don't make such a bally racket!
1089_134686_000026_000001 All the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently.
1089_134686_000032_000008 A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
1089_134686_000011_000003 He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so easily.
1089_134686_000014_000003 If ever his soul, re entering her dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star, BRIGHT AND MUSICAL, TELLING OF HEAVEN AND INFUSING PEACE, it was when her names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.
1089_134686_000024_000002 If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized?
1089_134686_000011_000001 Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear.
1089_134686_000009_000000 A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul.
1089_134686_000001_000001 He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly counselled him.
1089_134686_000009_000003 The chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself.
1089_134686_000007_000000 The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold itself together again.
1089_134686_000017_000000 Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:
1089_134686_000034_000000 --He had the faith in him that moves mountains.
1089_134686_000024_000006 Does a tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood?
1089_134686_000023_000001 The sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all, had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state.
1089_134686_000021_000000 Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying:
1089_134686_000012_000000 On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
1089_134686_000005_000001 Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.
1089_134686_000010_000001 Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is?
1089_134686_000011_000002 On Sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, outside the church, morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair oil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at.
1089_134686_000002_000004 Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified only by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of greeting:
1089_134686_000034_000005 A great fisher of souls!
1089_134686_000015_000003 The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out.
1089_134686_000009_000010 His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe of God, told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the All seeing and All knowing.
1089_134686_000005_000000 --Number ten.
1089_134686_000023_000000 It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation.
1089_134686_000007_000005 The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.
1089_134686_000002_000002 He would follow a devious course up and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner.
1089_134686_000009_000009 A certain pride, a certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night, though he knew it was in God's power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy.
1089_134686_000012_000004 The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed his barren pride.
1089_134686_000030_000001 Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
1089_134686_000028_000002 On Friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads.
1089_134686_000020_000000 --That's game ball.
1089_134686_000024_000000 As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd harsh face, his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it.
1089_134686_000020_000001 We can scut the whole hour.
1089_134686_000031_000000 The rector went on gravely:
1089_134686_000028_000006 But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a free day also.
1089_134686_000028_000003 If any boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to change.
1089_134686_000032_000006 He is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month.
1089_134686_000015_000002 But the dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts.
1089_134686_000007_000003 What music?
1089_134686_000002_000000 It would be a gloomy secret night.
1089_134686_000034_000004 A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
1089_134686_000024_000005 Why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divinity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone?
1089_134686_000034_000001 Ten thousand souls won for God in a single month!
1089_134686_000009_000004 He had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment.
1089_134686_000034_000003 A saint who has great power in heaven, remember: power to intercede for us in our grief; power to obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls; power above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin.
1089_134686_000012_000003 If at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces restrained him.
1089_134686_000009_000002 Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them.
1089_134686_000026_000003 A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.
1089_134686_000009_000001 At his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
1089_134686_000004_000000 --Is that you, pigeon?
1089_134686_000027_000000 The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from.
1089_134686_000022_000000 --Shut up, will you.
1089_134686_000024_000001 If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?
1089_134686_000029_000001 Why, sir?
1089_134686_000032_000005 He went from country to country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, baptizing the people.
1089_134686_000002_000003 The whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sin loving soul from their soft perfumed flesh.
1089_134686_000015_000001 He tried to think how it could be.
1089_134686_000030_000000 A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rector's grim smile.
1089_134686_000032_000001 He came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius.
1089_134686_000010_000000 --Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my stick!
1089_134686_000009_000008 What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction?
1089_134686_000024_000007 If the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present under their species as God and as man?
1089_134686_000018_000000 --The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.
1089_134686_000027_000001 He clasped his hands on the desk and said:
1089_134686_000032_000009 A great soldier of God!
1089_134686_000012_000002 The falsehood of his position did not pain him.
1089_134686_000006_000001 Coming in to have a short time?
1089_134691_000005_000000 The university!
1089_134691_000027_000000 Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty.
1089_134691_000014_000002 A faint click at his heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea; yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.
1089_134691_000044_000001 He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild heart of life.
1089_134691_000010_000001 It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, loving him as themselves.
1089_134691_000023_000000 --Help!
1089_134691_000024_000003 The towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater; and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair.
1089_134691_000002_000001 A full hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the university.
1089_134691_000045_000004 Her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her.
1089_134691_000022_000000 --Duck him!
1089_134691_000050_000002 What hour was it?
1089_134691_000033_000000 --One!...
1089_134691_000004_000000 Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he had read from her listless silence.
1089_134691_000006_000000 --Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.
1089_134691_000039_000001 He felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song.
1089_134691_000035_000002 An instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain.
1089_134691_000028_000001 His heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight.
1089_134691_000013_000002 Was it their colours?
1089_134691_000007_000001 All through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct.
1089_134691_000035_000000 His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds.
1089_134691_000020_000000 --Good man, Towser!
1089_134691_000014_000001 At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and, looking askance towards the water, he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide.
1089_134691_000001_000000 He could wait no longer.
1089_134691_000047_000000 --Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy.
1089_134691_000029_000002 Look out!
1089_134691_000004_000001 Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes.
1089_134691_000042_000002 The water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds.
1089_134691_000010_000000 Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration.
1089_134691_000046_000000 She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness.
1089_134691_000015_000002 Like a scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote.
1089_134691_000042_000003 The clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins.
1089_134691_000025_000000 He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words.
1089_134691_000008_000000 He turned seaward from the road at Dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet.
1089_134691_000038_000000 His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her grave clothes.
1089_134691_000016_000002 The Europe they had come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races.
1089_134691_000027_000003 A moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped City.
1089_134691_000007_000000 The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
1089_134691_000045_000003 Her thighs, fuller and soft hued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down.
1089_134691_000026_000002 Bous Stephaneforos!
1089_134691_000022_000001 Guzzle him now, Towser!
1089_134691_000013_000003 He allowed them to glow and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards, azure of waves, the grey fringed fleece of clouds.
1089_134691_000043_000000 Where was his boyhood now?
1089_134691_000020_000001 Duck him!
1089_134691_000016_000001 They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound.
1089_134691_000031_000000 --One!
1089_134691_000013_000004 No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and balance of the period itself.
1089_134691_000005_000006 Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from Newman:
1089_134691_000025_000001 How characterless they looked: Shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly without his Norfolk coat with the flapless side pockets! It was a pain to see them, and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness.
1089_134691_000049_000001 Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call.
1089_134691_000040_000000 He looked northward towards Howth.
1089_134691_000005_000005 It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves.
1089_134691_000024_000001 The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone.
1089_134691_000028_000003 An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs.
1089_134691_000045_000006 But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.
1089_134691_000055_000000 He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him.
1089_134691_000052_000000 He felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.
1089_134691_000039_000000 He started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood.
1089_134691_000008_000003 Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes.
1089_134691_000002_000002 For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he could wait no longer.
1089_134691_000023_000001 Help!...
1089_134691_000014_000000 He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again.
1089_134691_000048_000000 He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand.
1089_134691_000027_000001 Now, as never before, his strange name seemed to him a prophecy.
1089_134691_000025_000003 But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body.
1089_134691_000035_000001 This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar.
1089_134691_000003_000000 He set off abruptly for the Bull, walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe.
1089_134691_000013_000001 Words.
1089_134691_000027_000005 What did it mean?
1089_134691_000027_000006 Was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols, a hawk like man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being?
1089_134691_000053_000001 His eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world.
1089_134691_000005_000003 The end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him.
1089_134691_000037_000000 What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of death-the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him within and without-cerements, the linens of the grave?
1089_134691_000049_000002 To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!
1089_134691_000016_000000 Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slow drifting clouds, dappled and seaborne.
1089_134691_000024_000002 Their bodies, corpse white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their diving stone, poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre.
1089_134691_000008_000001 A squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the Bull and had begun to pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
1089_134691_000025_000002 Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls.
1089_134691_000053_000003 A world, a glimmer or a flower?
1089_134691_000026_000000 --Stephanos Dedalos!
1089_134691_000045_000005 Her bosom was as a bird's, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some dark plumaged dove.
1089_134691_000021_000000 --Come along, Dedalus!
1089_134691_000027_000002 So timeless seemed the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages were as one to him.
1089_134691_000024_000000 He recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces.
1089_134691_000053_000002 His soul was swooning into some new world, fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy shapes and beings.
1089_134691_000042_000001 Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved beneath the current, swaying and turning.
1089_134691_000015_000000 A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed.
1089_134691_000010_000002 Idle and embittering, finally, to argue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.
1089_134691_000029_000000 --One!
1089_134691_000054_000000 Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer.
1089_134691_000038_000004 He would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, impalpable, imperishable.
1089_134691_000015_000001 In the distance along the course of the slow flowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze.
1089_134691_000004_000002 A dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed, cloud like, leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.
1089_134691_000011_000000 He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself:
1089_134691_000049_000003 A wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory.
1089_134691_000027_000004 Now, at the name of the fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air.
2830_3979_000023_000000 Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, Good will to men.
2830_3979_000015_000000 "And what book would be your choice?"
2830_3979_000017_000001 Luther's commentary fills seven hundred and thirty three octavo pages in the Weidman Edition of his works.
2830_3979_000008_000001 The consultation had the twofold merit of definiteness and brevity.
2830_3979_000026_000000 THEODORE GRAEBNER
2830_3979_000009_000002 Will you do it?"
2830_3979_000007_000000 PREFACE
2830_3979_000010_000000 "I will, on one condition."
2830_3979_000018_000009 In other words, these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians, and Roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer.
2830_3979_000018_000005 My galatians, for instance."
2830_3979_000020_000000 At the end of his lectures in fifteen thirty one, Luther uttered a brief prayer and then dictated two Scriptural texts, which we shall inscribe at the end of these introductory remarks:
2830_3979_000006_000000 Translated by Theodore Graebner
2830_3979_000000_000001 All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.
2830_3979_000021_000000 "The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear, let Him also give us the power to serve and to do."
2830_3979_000018_000006 The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the American public were delivered in fifteen thirty one.
2830_3979_000018_000002 In his table talks the saying is recorded: "The Epistle to the galatians is my epistle.
2830_3979_000018_000000 The Reformer had lectured on this Epistle of saint Paul's in fifteen nineteen and again in fifteen twenty three.
2830_3979_000017_000002 It was written in Latin.
2830_3979_000018_000008 Roerer took down Luther's lectures and this manuscript has been preserved to the present day, in a copy which contains also additions by Veit Dietrich and by Cruciger, friends of Roerer's, who with him attended Luther's lectures.
2830_3979_000009_000001 We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market.
2830_3979_000017_000003 We were resolved not to present this entire mass of exegesis.
2830_3979_000017_000004 It would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages, ordinary octavo (like this), since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic of Latin, and particularly of Luther's Latin.
2830_3979_000014_000000 The demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one may as well offer Luther in the original German or Latin as expect the American church member to read any translations that would adhere to Luther's German or Latin constructions and employ the Mid Victorian type of English characteristic of the translations now on the market.
2830_3979_000025_000000 The Word of our God shall stand forever.
2830_3979_000017_000006 German and English translations are available, but the most acceptable English version, besides laboring under the handicaps of an archaic style, had to be condensed into half its volume in order to accomplish the "streamlining" of the book.
2830_3979_000019_000003 But the essence of Luther's lectures is there.
2830_3979_000011_000000 "And what is that?"
2830_3979_000018_000003 To it I am as it were in wedlock.
2830_3979_000018_000004 It is my Katherine." Much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin works, he remarked to his home circle: "If I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine.
2830_3979_000017_000005 The work had to be condensed.
2830_3979_000016_000001 Let us begin with that: his Commentary on galatians..."
2830_3979_000018_000001 It was his favorite among all the Biblical books.
2830_3979_000008_000000 The preparation of this edition of Luther's Commentary on galatians was first suggested to me by mr p j Zondervan, of the firm of publishers, in March, nineteen thirty seven.
2830_3979_000009_000000 "Luther is still the greatest name in Protestantism.
2830_3979_000012_000000 "The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American, 'streamline' him, so to speak-because you will never get people, whether in or outside the Lutheran Church, actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans."
2830_3979_000000_000000 This is a LibriVox recording.
2830_3979_000019_000001 It presents like no other of Luther's writings the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone.
2830_3979_000005_000000 By Martin Luther
2830_3980_000021_000000 Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the Gospel.
2830_3980_000017_000000 When men claiming such credentials come along, they deceive not only the naive, but also those who seemingly are well established in the faith. This same argument is used by the papacy.
2830_3980_000011_000000 VERSE one.
2830_3980_000016_000008 He has not seen Christ, nor has he had much contact with the other apostles. Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time."
2830_3980_000024_000003 My call is the highest possible, for it is by Jesus Christ, and God the Father."
2830_3980_000091_000002 I am angry with you." But his purpose was to call them back to the Gospel.
2830_3980_000108_000003 The devil knows better than to appear ugly and black.
2830_3980_000024_000000 Paul loses no time in defending himself against the charge that he had thrust himself into the ministry.
2830_3980_000106_000004 He puts on white to make himself look like an angel of light.
2830_3980_000108_000000 Today the Anabaptists and others, finding it difficult to condemn us, accuse us Lutherans of timidity in professing the whole truth.
2830_3980_000018_000002 He reminds them of the time when he opposed peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.
2830_3980_000018_000001 Humble man that he was, he will not now take a back seat.
2830_3980_000022_000000 Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise but to the praise of God.
2830_3980_000105_000001 Unto another gospel.
2830_3980_000024_000001 He says to the galatians: "My call may seem inferior to you.
2830_3980_000016_000004 We heard Him preach.
2830_3980_000022_000002 Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name, the grace, and the mercy of God.
2830_3980_000020_000000 The Certainty of Our Calling
2830_3980_000091_000005 It indicates his sorrow and his displeasure.
2830_3980_000012_000000 saint Paul wrote this epistle because, after his departure from the Galatian churches, Jewish Christian fanatics moved in, who perverted Paul's Gospel of man's free justification by faith in Christ Jesus.
2830_3980_000109_000003 This sort of thing brings the Gospel into trouble.
2830_3980_000019_000000 Paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his Gospel, affirming that he received it, not from men, but from the Lord Jesus Christ by special revelation, and that if he or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached, he shall be accursed.
2830_3980_000101_000000 VERSE six.
2830_3980_000070_000001 If he says, "Thou shalt be damned," you tell him: "No, for I fly to Christ who gave Himself for my sins.
2830_3980_000016_000001 They said to the galatians: "You have no right to think highly of Paul.
2830_3980_000026_000008 In fact I am an apostle."
2830_3980_000016_000007 Paul stands alone.
2830_3980_000023_000000 VERSE one.
2830_3980_000026_000005 The most they could claim is that they were sent by others.
2830_3980_000018_000000 Against these boasting, false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
2830_3980_000017_000001 "Do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church?
2830_3980_000021_000001 As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person, so the minister of Christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men.
2830_3980_000011_000001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead).
2830_3980_000105_000000 VERSE six.
2830_3980_000015_000000 These Jewish Christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the Galatian churches after Paul's departure, boasted that they were the descendants of Abraham, true ministers of Christ, having been trained by the apostles themselves, that they were able to perform miracles.
2830_3980_000014_000000 As a result we have this paradoxical situation: The Gospel supplies the world with the salvation of Jesus Christ, peace of conscience, and every blessing.
2830_3980_000014_000001 Just for that the world abhors the Gospel.
2830_3980_000016_000005 Paul came later and is beneath us.
2830_3980_000101_000001 From him that called you into the grace of Christ.
2830_3980_000109_000002 Unable to prevail by force, he engages wicked and ungodly teachers who at first make common cause with us, then claim that they are particularly called to teach the hidden mysteries of the Scriptures to superimpose upon the first principles of Christian doctrine that we teach.
2830_3980_000017_000002 Or do you suppose that God would have left His Church floundering in error all these centuries?" The galatians were taken in by such arguments with the result that Paul's authority and doctrine were drawn in question.
2830_3980_000023_000001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, etc)
2830_3980_000096_000001 It must be watched.
2830_3980_000016_000002 He was the last to turn to Christ.
2830_3980_000100_000001 There may be something to that.
237_126133_000026_000000 "Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you."
237_126133_000043_000000 "So you must," cried Jasper, enchanted at his success in amusing; "and I'll go with you."
237_126133_000047_000000 "Don't mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn't her fault."
237_126133_000005_000000 Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over, and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied, was seized to fly on the wings of the wind, to the flowers.
237_126133_000015_000003 "I shall have to give up!" she moaned.
237_126133_000010_000000 "Well," said Van, and he showed signs of relenting a little at that; "but Percy is perfectly awful, mamma, you don't know; and he feels so smart too," he said vindictively.
237_126133_000033_000001 "There, there," he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head. Something was going down the old gentleman's neck, that wet his collar, and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear, "don't give way now, Polly; Phronsie'll see you."
237_126133_000056_000001 "Oh, she couldn't help it," cried mr King, beginning to walk up and down the floor, and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy; "there wasn't the smallest use in thinking of anything else.
237_126133_000055_000000 "I didn't have any fears, if I worked it rightly," said the old gentleman complacently.
237_126133_000035_000000 "Phronsie," said Jasper quickly, "what do you suppose Prince said the other day?"
237_126133_000015_000001 Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237_126133_000059_000000 "So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
237_126133_000051_000002 To think that Phronsie had left her for any one!--even good mr King!
237_126133_000016_000000 "Where is she?" said a voice over in front of the piano, in the gathering dusk-unmistakably mr King's.
237_126133_000025_000000 That brought Polly to.
237_126133_000055_000001 "I wasn't coming without her, Marian, if it could possibly be managed.
237_126133_000021_000000 At this, the bundle opened suddenly, and-out popped Phronsie!
237_126133_000029_000000 "Boys," whispered their mother, warningly, "she can't answer you; just look at her face."
237_126133_000017_000001 "She must be there now, somewhere," and then somebody laughed.
237_126133_000023_000000 But Polly couldn't speak; and if Jasper hadn't caught her just in time, she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all!
237_126133_000024_000000 "Aren't you glad I've come, Polly?" asked Phronsie, with her little face close to Polly's own.
237_126133_000002_000004 It got to be noticed finally; and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever!
237_126133_000036_000000 "What?" asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Polly's arms, and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
237_126133_000008_000000 "I'd like it first rate to be away from Percy," said Van, reflectively; "I wouldn't come back in three, no, six weeks."
237_126133_000058_000000 "Well, she's a nice child," he said, "a very nice child; and," straightening himself up to his fullest height, and looking so very handsome, that his daughter could not conceal her admiration, "I shall always take care of Phronsie Pepper, Marian!"
237_126133_000002_000000 Yes, it must be confessed.
237_126133_000049_000000 But the chubby face didn't look up brightly, as usual: and the next moment, without a bit of warning, Phronsie sprang past them all, even Polly, and flung herself into mr King's arms, in a perfect torrent of sobs.
237_126133_000014_000000 But just here mr King thought it about time to take matters into his hands.
237_126133_000034_000000 "I know," gasped Polly, controlling her sobs; "I won't-only-I can't thank you!"
237_126133_000012_000000 "I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
237_126133_000020_000000 "Here, Polly, hold your arms," he had only strength to gasp.
237_126133_000007_000001 "Then, dear," said mrs Whitney, "you must be kinder to her than ever; think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends."
237_126133_000009_000000 "My son," said his mamma, "just stop and think how badly you would feel, if you really couldn't see Percy."
237_126133_000002_000003 At night, when no one knew it, the tears would come racing over the poor, forlorn little face, and would not be squeezed back.
237_126133_000056_000000 "So her mother was willing?" asked his daughter, curiously.
237_126133_000056_000003 At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.
237_126133_000022_000001 I'm here, Polly!"
237_126133_000046_000000 "Oh Phronsie!" cried Polly, turning around at the last words; "how could you!"
237_126133_000054_000000 "She's the cunningest little thing I ever saw," said mrs Whitney, enthusiastically, afterward, aside to mr King.
237_126133_000055_000003 "So you see, I was just in time; in the very nick of time, in fact!"
237_126133_000032_000001 "Father knew how to do it."
237_126133_000003_000000 The only place, except in front of the grand piano, where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness, was in the greenhouse.
237_126133_000019_000000 Polly sat up very straight, and whisked off the tears quickly.
237_126133_000030_000000 And to be sure, our Polly's face was a study to behold.
237_126133_000032_000000 "Isn't he splendid!" cried Jasper in intense pride, swelling up.
237_126133_000050_000000 "Dear me!" ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement; "and such a time as I've had to get her here too!" he added, staring around on the astonished group, none of whom had a word to say.
237_126133_000039_000001 Bark!'"
237_126133_000015_000004 "I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
237_126133_000060_000000 "So they have: so they have," assented mr King, and then the conversation dropped.
237_126133_000027_000000 "Weren't you awfully surprised?" cried Percy; "say, Polly, awfully?"
237_126133_000041_000000 "Yes, all alone by himself," asserted Jasper, vehemently, and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing; "he did now, truly, Phronsie."
237_126133_000031_000000 "Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
237_126133_000022_000000 "Here I'm!
237_126133_000013_000000 "I'm afraid those wouldn't quite answer the purpose," said his mamma, smiling-"especially the last; yet we must think of something."
237_126133_000028_000000 "Is her name Phronsie," put in Dick, unwilling to be left out, and not thinking of anything else to ask.
237_126133_000051_000001 All Jasper's frantic efforts at comfort, utterly failed.
237_126133_000048_000000 "Phronsie," said mrs Whitney, smilingly, stooping over the child, "would you like to see a little pussy I have for you?"
237_126133_000004_000000 Here she would stay, comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics, rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener, who since Polly's first rapturous entrance, had taken her into his good graces for all time.
237_126133_000057_000000 "And to think how fond the little girl is of you, father!" said mrs Whitney, who hadn't yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentleman's complete subjection to the little Peppers: he, whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully, and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate!
237_126133_000038_000000 "Be still," said Jappy warningly, while Phronsie stood surveying them all with grave eyes.
237_126133_000042_000001 yes, pretty soon now?"
237_126133_000014_000001 So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
237_126133_000015_000002 If she could only see Phronsie for just one moment!
237_126133_000051_000000 But Polly stood like a statue!
237_126133_000025_000001 "Oh, Phronsie!" she cried, and strained her to her heart; while the boys crowded around, and plied her with sudden questions.
237_126133_000033_000000 But Polly's arms were around the old gentleman's neck, so she didn't hear.
237_126133_000011_000000 "Well," said mrs Whitney, softly, "let's think what we can do for Polly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face."
237_126133_000001_000000 POLLY IS COMFORTED
237_126133_000049_000001 "Oh! let's go back!" was all they heard!
237_126133_000037_000000 "Oh ho, how funny!" laughed Van, while little Dick burst right out, "Japser!"
237_134493_000017_000010 All Angelique's folks are baking for it, and all Amedee's twenty cousins.
237_134493_000023_000002 You feel that, properly, Alexandra's house is the big out of doors, and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best.
237_134493_000005_000001 He wore a flannel cap and duck trousers, and the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to the elbow.
237_134493_000005_000005 The space between his two front teeth, which were unusually far apart, gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college. (He also played the cornet in the University band.)
237_134493_000023_000000 When you go out of the house into the flower garden, there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm; in the fencing and hedging, in the windbreaks and sheds, in the symmetrical pasture ponds, planted with scrub willows to give shade to the cattle in fly time.
237_134493_000017_000005 Amedee will be a handsome bridegroom.
237_134493_000008_000003 Alexandra lets you sleep late.
237_134493_000008_000000 "What time did you get over here?
237_134493_000006_000002 The old wild country, the struggle in which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke their hearts and died, he can scarcely remember.
237_134493_000005_000003 Unconscious respect, probably, for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts, and, like the Gladiator's, they were far away.
237_134493_000003_000000 The Divide is now thickly populated.
237_134493_000017_000016 They think you're proud because you've been away to school or something."
237_134493_000006_000000 When the grass required his close attention, or when he had to stoop to cut about a head stone, he paused in his lively air,--the "Jewel" song,--taking it up where he had left it when his scythe swung free again.
237_134493_000009_000003 Just wait till I finish off the Kourdnas'. By the way, they were Bohemians.
237_134493_000003_000004 The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
237_134493_000015_000000 Marie clucked to her horse.
237_134493_000005_000000 One June morning a young man stood at the gate of the Norwegian graveyard, sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to the tune he was whistling.
237_134493_000015_000001 "Oh, you know Annie!" She looked at the young man's bare arms.
237_134493_000007_000001 Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
237_134493_000018_000001 "How do you know they think that?"
237_134493_000006_000003 That is all among the dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter pattern life weaves to day, in the bright facts of being captain of the track team, and holding the interstate record for the high jump, in the all suffusing brightness of being twenty one.
237_134493_000007_000004 The wind was flapping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnut colored hair.
237_134493_000006_000004 Yet sometimes, in the pauses of his work, the young man frowned and looked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even twenty one might have its problems.
237_134493_000017_000014 You must dance with all the French girls.
237_134493_000009_000002 "Alexandra sent me to mow our lot, but I've done half a dozen others, you see.
237_134493_000017_000002 He felt it rather than saw it.
237_134493_000023_000001 There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard, under the walnut trees.
237_134493_000014_000006 Lou's wife needn't talk.
237_134493_000017_000000 "Will you?
237_134493_000002_000006 From the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses; the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields.
237_134493_000013_000001 "Oh, there's no denying you're a spunky little bunch, you Czechs," he called back over his shoulder.
237_134493_000012_000000 "We'd do it right over again, most of us," said the young woman hotly.
237_134493_000017_000009 Maybe the supper will tempt him.
237_134493_000005_000004 He was a splendid figure of a boy, tall and straight as a young pine tree, with a handsome head, and stormy gray eyes, deeply set under a serious brow.
237_134493_000007_000005 She shook her head at the tall youth.
237_134493_000014_000005 "I gave old man Lee a cut or so, too.
237_134493_000014_000003 She sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature, who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere; who are supple, and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances.
237_134493_000010_000000 "Free thinkers," replied the young woman laconically.
237_134493_000002_000002 Could he rise from beneath it, he would not know the country under which he has been asleep.
237_134493_000017_000004 "I've been up looking at Angelique's wedding clothes," Marie went on, "and I'm so excited I can hardly wait until Sunday.
237_134493_000007_000002 The cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice called, "Almost through, Emil?" He dropped his scythe and went toward the fence, wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief. In the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide shade hat, trimmed with red poppies.
237_134493_000003_000001 The rich soil yields heavy harvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts.
237_134493_000006_000001 He was not thinking about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered.
237_134493_000008_000001 That's not much of a job for an athlete.
237_134493_000007_000000 When he had been mowing the better part of an hour, he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him.
237_134493_000017_000003 Indeed, he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it.
237_134493_000008_000006 I was going to give you a lift, if you were done." She gathered up her reins.
237_134493_000017_000006 Is anybody but you going to stand up with him?
237_134493_000002_000004 From the Norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board, marked off in squares of wheat and corn; light and dark, dark and light.
237_134493_000022_000002 The pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchen-where Alexandra's three young Swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle and preserve all summer long-and the sitting room, in which Alexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the Bergsons used in their first log house, the family portraits, and the few things her mother brought from Sweden.
237_134493_000017_000001 Oh, there's a good boy!" She turned her head to him with a quick, bright smile.
237_134493_000021_000004 On either side of the road, for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill, stood tall osage orange hedges, their glossy green marking off the yellow fields.
237_134493_000009_000004 Why aren't they up in the Catholic graveyard?"
237_134493_000011_000002 They still jaw about it in history classes."
237_134493_000021_000003 There was something individual about the great farm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
237_134493_000007_000003 Her face, too, was rather like a poppy, round and brown, with rich color in her cheeks and lips, and her dancing yellow brown eyes bubbled with gayety.
237_134493_000014_000000 Marie Shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical movement of the young man's long arms, swinging her foot as if in time to some air that was going through her mind.
237_134493_000004_000003 The air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled, as if the one were the breath of the other.
237_134493_000022_000000 If you go up the hill and enter Alexandra's big house, you will find that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort.
237_134493_000021_000001 There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village.
237_134493_000017_000012 If once I get Frank to the supper, I'll see that I stay for the dance.
237_134493_000021_000006 Any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the Divide, and that the farmer was a woman, Alexandra Bergson.
237_134493_000004_000001 It gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the season, holding nothing back.
237_134493_000002_000005 Telephone wires hum along the white roads, which always run at right angles.
237_134493_000009_000000 "But I will be, in a minute.
237_134493_000022_000001 One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished; the next is almost bare.
237_134493_000002_000003 The shaggy coat of the prairie, which they lifted to make him a bed, has vanished forever.
237_134493_000015_000002 "How brown you've got since you came home.
237_134493_000002_000001 His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields.
237_134493_000021_000002 A stranger, approaching it, could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields.
237_134493_000003_000003 The wheat cutting sometimes goes on all night as well as all day, and in good seasons there are scarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting.
237_134493_000000_000001 Neighboring Fields
237_134493_000015_000004 I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries."
237_134493_000017_000011 There will be barrels of beer.
237_134493_000008_000002 Here I've been to town and back.
237_134493_000009_000001 Please wait for me, Marie," Emil coaxed.
237_134493_000015_000003 I wish I had an athlete to mow my orchard.
237_134493_000004_000002 Like the plains of Lombardy, it seems to rise a little to meet the sun
237_134493_000021_000000 They drove westward toward Norway Creek, and toward a big white house that stood on a hill, several miles across the fields.
237_134493_000008_000005 Lou's wife was telling me about the way she spoils you.
237_134493_000011_000000 "Lots of the Bohemian boys at the University are," said Emil, taking up his scythe again.
237_134493_000017_000015 It hurts their feelings if you don't.
237_134500_000032_000000 Marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded.
237_134500_000004_000004 That invitation decided her.
237_134500_000016_000000 "Why is it?
237_134500_000024_000004 I like him because he appreciates her more than you do."
237_134500_000026_000000 "Oh, Emil!
237_134500_000035_000002 "That's what you miss, Marie.
237_134500_000004_000002 The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
237_134500_000004_000006 Emil had already begun work and was mowing vigorously.
237_134500_000041_000000 Emil gripped the hand holds of his scythe and began to mow.
237_134500_000006_000000 "If I cut the grass, I will," Emil said teasingly.
237_134500_000023_000001 "Alexandra's never been in love, you crazy!" He laughed again.
237_134500_000034_000002 And you never used to be cross to me."
237_134500_000024_000002 If you had any eyes, you would see that she is very fond of him.
237_134500_000012_000000 Marie went on as if she had not heard him.
237_134500_000003_000004 Frank and Lou Bergson had very similar ideas, and they were two of the political agitators of the county.
237_134500_000036_000003 And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand!" She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
237_134500_000035_000003 You'll have to get some other little boy to play with." He stopped and took a deep breath.
237_134500_000036_000001 She had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress. "But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over, we can never do nice things together any more.
237_134500_000023_000002 "She wouldn't know how to go about it.
237_134500_000007_000004 Oh, I don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where there are so many.
237_134500_000016_000002 I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.
237_134500_000015_000000 "That's a poor saying," said Emil, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
237_134500_000007_000000 "Am I flighty?
237_134500_000024_000000 Marie shrugged her shoulders.
237_134500_000023_000003 The idea!"
237_134500_000007_000007 Good bye.
237_134500_000003_000001 She thought it hard that the Goulds, for whom she had nothing but good will, should make her so much trouble.
237_134500_000016_000001 If I feel that way, I feel that way.
237_134500_000034_000001 "Everything I say makes you cross, don't it?
237_134500_000005_000005 Didn't it blow dreadfully?
237_134500_000025_000001 "What are you talking about, Marie?
237_134500_000036_000002 We shall have to behave like mr Linstrum.
237_134500_000019_000000 "Yes.
237_134500_000034_000000 She sighed despondently.
237_134500_000035_000006 It's then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together.
237_134500_000009_000000 That summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than Shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn; the orchard was a neglected wilderness.
237_134500_000005_000008 We never had so many of them in here before.
237_134500_000017_000001 He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet, insipid fruit,--long ivory colored berries, tipped with faint pink, like white coral, that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through.
237_134500_000005_000003 When I heard it raining in the night, I thought maybe you would come and do it for me to day.
237_134500_000024_000001 "Oh, you don't know Alexandra as well as you think you do!
237_134500_000025_000004 What more do you want?
237_134500_000011_000000 Emil paused and straightened his back.
237_134500_000003_000003 Frank was always reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged. He had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and follies, how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers with impunity whenever they chose.
237_134500_000020_000000 "Oh, ever so much; only he seems kind of staid and school teachery. But, of course, he is older than Frank, even.
237_134500_000022_000000 "Oh, Emil, you know what I mean!" Marie tossed her head impatiently. "Does she really care about him?
237_134500_000032_000001 "I wish you weren't so restless, and didn't get so worked up over things," she said sadly.
237_134500_000024_000003 It would serve you all right if she walked off with Carl.
237_134500_000030_000000 "That's so," Marie sighed.
237_134500_000026_000001 Surely you are not thinking of going off there?"
237_134500_000036_000007 I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself."
237_134500_000011_000002 About like the Germans', wasn't it?"
237_134500_000037_000001 Emil stood defiant, gazing down at her.
237_134500_000001_000002 One of the Goulds was getting a divorce, and Frank took it as a personal affront.
237_134500_000035_000004 Then he went on in a low tone, so intense that it was almost threatening: "Sometimes you seem to understand perfectly, and then sometimes you pretend you don't.
237_134500_000009_000003 When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
237_134500_000036_000005 It will go away, and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
237_134500_000025_000003 She and I have always been good friends.
237_134500_000022_000001 When she used to tell me about him, I always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him."
237_134500_000004_000007 When he saw her coming, he stopped and wiped his brow.
237_134500_000029_000001 Alexandra can run the farm all right, without me.
237_134500_000014_000002 I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get along with caring for trees, if I hadn't anything else."
237_134500_000008_000001 In a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail, and he began to swing his scythe with that long, even stroke that few American boys ever learn.
237_134500_000027_000000 "Why not?
237_134500_000007_000006 Look at the spider webs all over the grass.
237_134500_000005_000010 Will you have to cut them, too?"
237_134500_000004_000001 After he was gone, Marie went out to the back porch to begin her butter making. A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
237_134500_000028_000002 "I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here," she murmured.
237_134500_000029_000003 I want to be doing something on my own account."
237_134500_000033_000000 "Thank you," he returned shortly.
237_134500_000011_000001 "I don't know.
237_134500_000005_000007 They are always so spicy after a rain.
237_134500_000009_000001 All sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there; splotches of wild larkspur, pale green and white spikes of hoarhound, plantations of wild cotton, tangles of foxtail and wild wheat.
237_134500_000035_000001 "I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
237_134500_000004_000008 His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
237_134500_000005_000006 Just smell the wild roses!
237_134500_000003_000002 She hated to see the Sunday newspapers come into the house.
237_134500_000002_000001 Listen here what he do wit his money." And Frank began the catalogue of the young man's reputed extravagances.
237_134500_000025_000005 I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there."
237_134500_000006_000002 What makes you so flighty?"
237_134500_000035_000007 If you WON'T understand, you know, I could make you!"
237_134500_000036_000004 "That won't last.
237_134500_000007_000005 Aren't you splashed!
237_134500_000038_000000 "I can't pray to have the things I want," he said slowly, "and I won't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it."
237_134500_000030_000002 Almost anything you choose."
237_134500_000005_000004 The wind wakened me.
237_134500_000005_000009 I suppose it's the wet season.
237_134500_000014_000001 The old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest, and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times.
237_134500_000004_000005 She ran into the house, put on a short skirt and a pair of her husband's boots, caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard.
237_134500_000035_000000 Emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head. He stood in an attitude of self defense, his feet well apart, his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides, so that the cords stood out on his bare arms.
237_134500_000013_000001 "Do they?
237_134500_000017_000000 Emil had nothing to say to this.
237_134500_000001_000001 Frank sat up until a late hour reading the Sunday newspapers.
237_134500_000036_000006 The Church helps people, indeed it does.
237_134500_000027_000003 "Would you rather I went off in the sand hills and lived like Ivar?"
237_134500_000014_000000 "I don't know all of them, but I know lindens are.
237_134500_000016_000003 I feel as if this tree knows everything I ever think of when I sit here.
237_134500_000001_000004 Frank read English slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the angrier he grew.
237_134500_000005_000001 I'm going to pick cherries. Isn't everything beautiful after the rain?
237_134500_000013_000002 Well, which are the lucky trees? I'd like to know."
237_134500_000007_000003 Please leave the roses till last, if you must cut them.
237_134500_000017_000002 He dropped a handful into her lap.
237_134500_000040_000001 I never expect to have any more."
237_134500_000040_000000 "Yes; over.
237_134500_000023_000000 "Who, Alexandra?" Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets.
237_134500_000028_000000 Marie's face fell under his brooding gaze.
237_134500_000005_000000 "Don't let me disturb you, Emil.
237_134500_000028_000001 She looked down at his wet leggings.
237_134500_000001_000006 He turned to his farm hand who was reading the other half of the paper.
237_134500_000035_000005 You don't help things any by pretending.
237_134500_000007_000001 I suppose that's the wet season, too, then.
237_134500_000027_000001 I must go somewhere, mustn't I?"
237_134500_000001_000003 In printing the story of the young man's marital troubles, the knowing editor gave a sufficiently colored account of his career, stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it.
237_134500_000001_000000 On the evening of the day of Alexandra's call at the Shabatas', a heavy rain set in.
237_134500_000020_000002 Do you think Alexandra likes him very much?"
237_134500_000007_000002 It's exciting to see everything growing so fast,--and to get the grass cut!
237_134500_000031_000001 "Sometimes I don't want to do anything at all, and sometimes I want to pull the four corners of the Divide together,"--he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk,--"so, like a table cloth.
237_134500_000021_000001 They were old friends."
237_134500_000005_000002 Oh, but I'm glad to get this place mowed!
237_134500_000009_000002 South of the apricot trees, cornering on the wheatfield, was Frank's alfalfa, where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms.
237_134500_000039_000000 Marie turned away, wringing her hands.
237_134500_000031_000002 I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down, up and down."
237_134500_000031_000000 "And there are so many, many things I can't do." Emil echoed her tone sarcastically.
237_134500_000007_000008 I'll call you if I see a snake."
237_134500_000041_000001 Marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house, crying bitterly.
237_134500_000019_000001 Don't you?"
237_134500_000036_000000 Marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat.
237_134500_000018_000000 "Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
4970_29095_000018_000001 A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine! Does thee think thee could stand it six months?
4970_29095_000008_000000 "I know," said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, "thee chafes against all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do?
4970_29095_000047_000000 What a sweet voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.
4970_29095_000052_000001 But he only said,
4970_29095_000032_000002 Any departure from either color or shape would be instantly taken note of.
4970_29095_000054_000001 But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself.
4970_29095_000040_000002 Is he going to start a daily newspaper among the Kick a poos?"
4970_29095_000025_000000 "If I can get patients."
4970_29095_000013_000000 "I have not asked him," ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers.
4970_29095_000018_000002 And the lectures, and the dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?"
4970_29095_000055_000002 He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when he went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as he stumbled along.
4970_29095_000054_000000 ruth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't understand her.
4970_29095_000027_000002 She had begun her open battle.
4970_29095_000002_000002 It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be the deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to its feasts.
4970_29095_000052_000000 Friend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of Meeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his belief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle of his, hatched in a Friend's dove cote.
4970_29095_000034_000000 "Why should I? I've been again and again.
4970_29095_000053_000000 "Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career thee wants?"
4970_29095_000015_000000 ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone, said,
4970_29095_000006_000000 "I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans."
4970_29095_000001_000000 CHAPTER fourteen.
4970_29095_000003_000001 Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park, four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples, without having seen.
4970_29095_000055_000003 The rather common place and unformed hand writing seemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any other woman.
4970_29095_000030_000001 The truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the Yearly Meeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly circles.
4970_29095_000042_000000 "What sort of business can a young man go into without capital?"
4970_29095_000051_000000 "Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything," retorted the sharp little disputant.
4970_29095_000027_000001 It was out now.
4970_29095_000019_000001 I know I can go through the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all.
4970_29095_000020_000000 "But thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe application.
4970_29095_000034_000001 If I go to Meeting at all I like best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows are all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves. It's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out.
4970_29095_000049_000001 Why should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl? What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die?
4970_29095_000049_000003 And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a useless life?"
4970_29095_000002_000001 It was one of the pleasantest of the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is territorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive strip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic ocean.
4970_29095_000032_000000 "I have nothing to wear," replied that demure person.
4970_29095_000049_000000 "I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
4970_29095_000005_000000 "Well, mother," said the young student, looking up, with a shade of impatience.
4970_29095_000019_000000 "Mother," said ruth calmly, "I have thought it all over.
4970_29095_000007_000000 "Mother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled me, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit."
4970_29095_000040_000001 It was time for him to do something.
4970_29095_000027_000000 ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed.
4970_29095_000017_000000 Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.
4970_29095_000021_000000 "I will practice it."
4970_29095_000026_000000 "I hope at least, ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an office," said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in, as she rose and left the room.
4970_29095_000037_000000 "Yes.
4970_29095_000003_000002 But ruth confessed that she was tired of them, and also of the Mint.
4970_29095_000033_000000 "And thee won't go?"
4970_29095_000028_000004 If they were orphans, would they like to be brought up in a Grecian temple?
4970_29095_000002_000000 The letter that Philip Sterling wrote to ruth Bolton, on the evening of setting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in her own father's house in Philadelphia.
4970_29095_000036_000000 "Thee has another letter from young Sterling," said Eli Bolton.
4970_29095_000049_000002 What one useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and the children?
4970_29095_000019_000003 What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living?"
4970_29095_000019_000002 Does thee think I lack nerve?
4970_29095_000034_000002 No, I don't feel at home there."
4970_29095_000011_000000 "I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the piano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room when it is played.
4970_29095_000056_000000 ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him. She should pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the Indians, in saint Louis, would not take his scalp.
4970_29095_000029_000001 Wasn't it the broadest and the longest street in the world?
4970_29095_000008_000001 Why is thee so discontented?"
4970_29095_000039_000000 "He doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything beyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a Wednesday Meeting."
4970_29095_000003_000000 It was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that made ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out doors nor the in doors.
4970_29095_000045_000000 This excellent advice did not seem to impress ruth greatly, for she was looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her grey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,
4970_29095_000003_000003 She was tired of other things.
4970_29095_000003_000004 She tried this morning an air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice, and then seating herself by the open window, read Philip's letter.
4970_29095_000004_000000 "ruth?"
4970_29095_000003_000007 After a time she took up a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance about as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but her face was soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it that she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.
4970_29095_000055_000001 Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she did; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the letter than about him.
4970_29095_000028_000002 Think of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick!
4970_29095_000041_000001 He's going into business."
4970_29095_000050_000000 "Has thy mother led a useless life?"
4970_29095_000051_000001 "What's the good, father, of a series of human beings who don't advance any?"
4970_29095_000011_000002 I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now."
4970_29095_000020_000001 And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?"
4970_29095_000012_000000 "Thy ways greatly try me, ruth, and all thy relations.
4970_29095_000035_000000 That evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawing room fire, as they were quite apt to do at night.
4970_29095_000028_000000 The sight seers returned in high spirits from the city.
4970_29095_000024_000000 "Where thee and thy family are known?"
4970_29095_000003_000005 Was she thinking about Philip, as she gazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or of that world which his entrance, into her tradition bound life had been one of the means of opening to her?
4970_29095_000029_000000 And then there was Broad street!
4970_29095_000046_000002 Father, I should like to break things and get loose!"
4970_29095_000032_000001 "If thee wants to see new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting.
4970_29095_000009_000000 "If I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead level."
4970_29095_000011_000001 Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so they can't discipline him.
4970_29095_000003_000006 Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing, as one might see by the expression of her face.
4970_29095_000037_000001 Philip has gone to the far west."
4970_29095_000044_000000 "I should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too.
4970_29095_000028_000003 ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum, with its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body?
4970_29095_000031_000000 "Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, ruth?" asked one of the girls.
4970_29095_000038_000000 "How far?"
4970_29095_000054_000002 She also had a history, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the cage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had passed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind, which has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re arrange the world.
4970_29093_000049_000000 To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York capitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening.
4970_29093_000039_000000 "When do you go?" was Philip's next question, after some moments of silence.
4970_29093_000047_000001 We will find the place itself.
4970_29093_000020_000003 He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it.
4970_29093_000004_000000 "Well, why don't you go into something?
4970_29093_000035_000000 "I don't know an engine from a coal cart."
4970_29093_000006_000002 He has no traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for himself.
4970_29093_000024_000000 "Well, make it that.
4970_29093_000047_000000 "Never mind the map.
4970_29093_000036_000002 It's easy enough.
4970_29093_000013_000003 If he were good enough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary, who were seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry.
4970_29093_000028_000004 He never was so summoned, but none of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of Commerce.
4970_29093_000050_000007 No time or distance, however, would ever lessen his interest in her.
4970_29093_000050_000002 He well knew the perils of the frontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the dangers of fever.
4970_29093_000020_000001 It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius, but mere plodding and grubbing.
4970_29093_000034_000000 "Well, I'm going as an engineer.
4970_29093_000046_000001 We'll get a map."
4970_29093_000050_000003 But there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself.
4970_29093_000020_000002 Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed his genius.
4970_29093_000017_000001 In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers accepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page, and, behold, his vocation was open to him.
4970_29093_000044_000001 If they disapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know.
4970_29093_000038_000000 "Why don't you see?
4970_29093_000027_000000 But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to fail.
4970_29093_000049_000001 He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
4970_29093_000006_000001 He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object.
4970_29093_000032_000002 You know my uncle is a great railroad man.
4970_29093_000048_000001 He wouldn't bother her with business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years.
4970_29093_000026_000000 "O, very well," said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt, "you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that."
4970_29093_000048_000000 Philip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening.
4970_29093_000043_000000 On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and suits of India rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere.
4970_29093_000031_000000 "I think I should like it of all things," replied Philip, with some hesitation, "but what for."
4970_29093_000022_000000 "Take it of course," says Gringo, "take anything that offers, why not?"
4970_29093_000041_000000 "No, its not too soon.
4970_29093_000050_000000 It was to ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last.
4970_29093_000032_000001 We are going, a lot of us, railroad men, engineers, contractors.
4970_29093_000028_000000 It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly.
4970_29093_000027_000001 And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.
4970_29093_000044_000002 Happy youth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an hour's notice.
4970_29093_000050_000005 If he returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps.
4970_29093_000001_000000 CHAPTER twelve.
4970_29093_000015_000001 Besides Philip hated the copying of pleadings, and he was certain that a life of "whereases" and "aforesaids" and whipping the devil round the stump, would be intolerable.
4970_29093_000004_000001 You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library."
4970_29093_000010_000000 Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue!
4970_29093_000029_000000 The two were intimate at that time,--they had been classmates-and saw a great deal of each other.
4970_29093_000050_000001 He might never see her again; he went to seek his fortune.
4970_29093_000036_000000 "Field engineer, civil engineer.
4970_29093_000012_000000 Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any exception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.
4970_29093_000047_000002 I was afraid it was nearer home."
4970_29093_000002_000000 "Oh, it's easy enough to make a fortune," Henry said.
4970_29093_000038_000002 We wouldn't engineer long."
4970_29093_000007_000000 Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he felt that he could be a rich man.
4970_29093_000023_000000 "But they want me to make it an opposition paper."
4970_29093_000014_000003 He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart, a broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face.
4970_29093_000050_000006 If he was unsuccessful, or if he never returned-perhaps it would be as well.
4970_29093_000017_000002 He would make his mark in literature.
4970_29093_000006_000000 To the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon.
4970_29093_000017_000000 His pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into other scribbling.
4970_29093_000050_000004 Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life.
4970_29093_000050_000008 He would say good night, but not good bye.
4970_29093_000007_000001 He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere desire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.
4970_29093_000019_000001 He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.
4970_29093_000010_000001 Will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddle bow?
4970_29093_000029_000001 Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street, in a boarding house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity.
4970_29093_000042_000002 It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are settled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west.
4970_29093_000033_000000 "But in what capacity would I go?"
4970_29093_000036_000001 You can begin by carrying a rod, and putting down the figures.
4970_29093_000028_000001 He frequently accompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with regularity every day.
4970_29093_000003_000000 "It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think," replied Philip.
4970_29093_000040_000000 "To morrow.
4970_29093_000024_000001 That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect the next president."
4970_29093_000032_000000 "Oh, it's a big operation.
4970_29093_000044_000000 The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends.
4970_29093_000013_000000 The fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth.
4970_29093_000037_000000 "Yes, but what is it for, what is it all about?"
4970_29093_000046_000000 "Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think.
4970_29093_000014_000002 Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper, and a clear hearty laugh.
61_70970_000007_000001 Go to her."
7176_92135_000058_000001 Charming.
7176_92135_000012_000004 There are ways of shifting the eyebrows, distending the nostrils, and exploring the lower molars with the tongue by which it is possible to denote respectively Surprise, Defiance and Doubt.

7176_92135_000085_000003 It has been said before, but you may feel that it is quite time it was said again; besides, for all the audience knows, Lord john may simply be quoting.
7176_92135_000024_000001 It is to let Hamlet, if that happen to be the name of your character, enter with a small dog, pet falcon, mongoose, tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part, and confide in this animal such sorrows, hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know.
7176_92135_000002_000000 THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST
7176_92135_000034_000001 Arthur!
7176_92135_000006_000003 But suppose you said, "I'm fond of writing; my people always say my letters home are good enough for 'Punch.' I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman, and-but perhaps I'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment.

7176_92135_000015_000000 Well, there are more ways than one; and now we come to what is meant by stagecraft.
7176_92135_000005_000002 How shall this success be achieved?
7176_92135_000031_000006 Was it only a coincidence?
7176_92135_000085_000004 Now this answer, even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls, will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette.
7176_92135_000011_000000 And, so on in the same vein for some thirty lines.
7176_92135_000045_000002 Whatever-
7176_92135_000055_000000 The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
7176_92135_000035_000001 You will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written:--
7176_92135_000053_000001 You will, of course, appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time, but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural.
7176_92135_000067_000001 You will never be a dramatist until you have learnt the technique of
7176_92135_000069_000002 A stage meal is popular, because it proves to the audience that the actors, even when called Charles Hawtrey or Owen Nares, are real people just like you and me.
7176_92135_000084_000000 But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection.
7176_92135_000083_000000 Tea is the most usual meal on the stage, for the reason that it is the least expensive, the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night.
7176_92135_000006_000000 Frankly I cannot always say.
7176_92135_000012_000003 Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.
7176_92135_000058_000003 Do play it again.
7176_92135_000004_000000 But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.
7176_92135_000004_000002 It was an unsatisfying life; and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the Bar.
7176_92135_000022_000022 To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler-
7176_92135_000006_000002 How shall I do it?"--well, I couldn't help you.
7176_92135_000013_000000 So the soliloquy came into being.
7176_92135_000032_000001 If that be so, he must explain it.
7176_92135_000023_000001 You see how effective it is.
7176_92135_000081_000001 Good bye; so glad you could come.
7176_92135_000076_000001 Sugar?
7176_92135_000031_000004 The obvious answer, that the firm which is mentioned in the programme as supplying his trousers would be annoyed if he didn't, is not enough; nor is it enough to say that the whole plot of the piece hinges on him, and that without him the drama would languish.
7176_92135_000085_000001 Let us assume that Lord Arthur asks Lord john what a cynic is-the question of what a cynic is having arisen quite naturally in the course of the plot.
7176_92135_000069_000001 Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage.
7176_92135_000058_000002 Quite one of my favourites.
7176_92135_000015_000001 Stagecraft is the art of getting over these and other difficulties, and (if possible) getting over them in a showy manner, so that people will say, "How remarkable his stagecraft is for so young a writer," when otherwise they mightn't have noticed it at all.
7176_92135_000003_000002 The successful playwright is indeed a man to be envied. Leaving aside for the moment the question of super tax, the prizes which fall to his lot are worth something of an effort.
7176_92135_000090_000001 A cynic is a man who, etc
7176_92135_000074_000001 Tea, please, Matthews.
7176_92135_000014_000000 What, then, is to be done?
7176_92135_000028_000001 Which strikes me as rather sweet and natural.
7176_92135_000092_000000 Well, I see I must tell you.
7176_92135_000070_000003 This is how it should go:--
7176_92135_000089_000001 Once more:---
7176_92135_000022_000021 Yes, that's right.
7176_92135_000085_000000 Now although it is possible, in the case of a few men at the top of the profession, to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor, you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage directions the particular movements (with match and so forth) that you wish carried out.
7176_92135_000022_000020 No, "be"--b e.
7176_92135_000056_000002 Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that we are assisting at an At Home of considerable splendour.
7176_92135_000085_000002 Let us assume further that you wish Lord john to reply, "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
7176_92135_000071_000001 How do you do?
7176_92135_000075_000001 Yes, m'lady.
7176_92135_000006_000006 Can you give me a few hints?"--suppose you spoke to me like this, then I could do something for you.
7176_92135_000022_000008 Hamlet speaking.
7176_92135_000006_000005 The only thing is, I don't know anything about technique and stagecraft and the three unities and that sort of rot.
7176_92135_000006_000008 Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is." And I should begin with a short homily on
7176_92135_000018_000000 And so on, till you get to the end, when Ophelia might say, "Ah, yes," or something non committal of that sort.
7176_92135_000028_000000 And so on.
7176_92135_000030_000000 EXITS AND ENTRANCES
7176_92135_000022_000014 Is that you, Exchange?
7176_92135_000072_000001 Thank you.
7176_92135_000012_000001 Now the object of this soliloquy is plain.
7176_92135_000094_000000 It makes a different thing of it altogether.
7176_92135_000068_000000 MEALS
7176_92135_000077_000001 No, thanks.
7176_92135_000056_000003 Most of the characters seem to be on the stage, and for once we do not ask how they got there.
7176_92135_000020_000000 Let us, to give an example of how this method works, go back again to the play we have been discussing.
7176_92135_000084_000001 Without the stage cigarette many an epigram would pass unnoticed, many an actor's hands would be much more noticeable; and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to his job.
7176_92135_000003_000004 In short he becomes a "prominent figure in London Society"--and, if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
7176_92135_000019_000003 Could anything be more natural?
7176_92135_000083_000005 Besides, the thing is coming back again as chicken directly.
7176_92135_000083_000003 The etiquette is to have two bites before the butler and the three footmen whisk away the plate.
7176_92135_000040_000001 What is it?
7176_92135_000022_000010 To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows-What? No, Hamlet speaking.
7176_92135_000031_000003 Why did Lord Arthur Fluffinose enter?
7176_92135_000070_000002 Let your actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic tea.
7176_92135_000008_000000 If you ever read your "Shakespeare"--and no dramatist should despise the works of another dramatist; he may always pick up something in them which may be useful for his next play-if you ever read your "Shakespeare," it is possible that you have come across this passage:
7176_92135_000007_000000 SOLILOQUY
7176_92135_000018_000001 This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
7176_92135_000018_000002 What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet's thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner.
7176_92135_000012_000000 These few remarks are called a soliloquy, being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage.
7176_92135_000006_000007 "My dear Sir," I should reply (or Madam), "you have come to the right shop.
7176_88083_000011_000005 It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward, flapping through the tips of the branches.
7176_88083_000020_000002 His flies, as befitted these amber brown, tumultuous northern streams, were large and conspicuous-a Parmacheenie Belle for the tail fly, with a Montreal and a Red Hackle for the drops.
7176_88083_000012_000004 His swoop became a demonstration merely, an expression of his rage at having his prey thus snatched from his beak. With one short, shrill cry of anger, he swerved off and sailed upward over the river.
7176_88083_000022_000001 He saw the frantic fugitive dive over the ledge and disappear.
7176_88083_000016_000000 The drake sank again instantly.
7176_88083_000018_000002 But water was all they clutched.
7176_88083_000011_000006 The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.
7176_88083_000011_000001 But the hawk was already close upon him.
7176_88083_000004_000001 It was not in the quiet pools and long, deep reaches of dark water that he loved to seek his prey, but rather to snatch it from the grasp of the loud chutes and the roaring rips.
7176_88083_000011_000002 In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.
7176_88083_000006_000003 But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks, and eagles.
7176_88083_000022_000003 He tried to check his cast, but it was too late.
7176_88083_000008_000002 Here he proceeded to swallow his prize head first.
7176_88083_000016_000004 Once more he half emerged, filled his gasping lungs, and pounded onward desperately, half flying and half swimming.
7176_88083_000024_000007 He rose noisily into the air, made a detour over the tree tops to avoid the fisherman, and flew back to his dead branch overhanging the amber rush of the chutes.
7176_88083_000023_000000 The last drop fly, as luck would have it, caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak, hooking itself firmly.
7176_88083_000017_000006 The marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters.
7176_88083_000017_000000 Immediately over his outstretched gleaming head flew the hawk.
7176_88083_000002_000000 He was plainly a duck.
7176_88083_000002_000003 He was too imposing in appearance, too gorgeous in apparel, too bold and vigilant in demeanor to be so misunderstood.
7176_88083_000023_000008 The fisherman reeled in the limp coils, and the worried hawk flew off with the flies.
7176_88083_000006_000005 Had he taken such a prize, he could not have profited by it, having no means of tearing it to pieces.
7176_88083_000018_000007 But, as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam, while doom hung low above his head, yet hesitated to strike.
7176_88083_000003_000002 It directly overhung a transparent amber brown chute of unbroken water in the midst of the loud turmoil of North Fork Rapids.
7176_88083_000022_000000 Just as he made his cast, he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend.
7176_88083_000023_000004 The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him, and appalling.
7176_88083_000015_000003 With only head and wings above the mad smother, he flapped onward frantically, beating down the foam about him.
7176_88083_000018_000001 Immediately beyond the lip of the ledge the hawk lifted his wings high over his back and struck downward, so that his talons went deep into the water.
7176_88083_000024_000006 The drake was suspicious of men, though he did not greatly fear them, as he and his rank fleshed tribe were not interesting to the hunters.
7176_88083_000019_000003 Then, in the still water, unless he should chance upon a hiding place, the drake would soon be forced to come to the top for breath, and those throttling talons would instantly close upon his neck.
7176_88083_000018_000005 The pool was, perhaps, a hundred yards in length.
7176_88083_000007_000001 A watcher directly overhead, escaping the baffling reflections, might have seen him swimming, head outstretched, mastering the tremendous rush of the stream with mighty strokes, fairly out speeding the fish in their own element. Near the limit of the clear water he overtook and seized the quarry which he had marked-a trout not far from seven inches in length.
7176_88083_000012_000003 But wisdom came to him just in time, and he did not strike home.
7176_88083_000019_000004 But the antic forest Fates, wearied of the simple routine of the wilderness, had decreed an altogether novel intervention, and were giggling in their cloaks of ancient moss.
7176_88083_000018_000004 The hawk followed, his wing tips now almost brushing the water.
7176_88083_000002_000004 Moreover, he was not in the situation or the surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks.
7176_88083_000023_000007 Then the leader parted from the line.
7176_88083_000004_000000 The duck was a handsome male of the red breasted merganser family, and the absorbing interest of his life was fish.
7176_88083_000023_000002 At the same moment he felt the light restraint of the almost invisible leader upon his wings, where the other two flies had affixed themselves.
7176_88083_000018_000000 A few yards further on, the torrent fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet.
7176_88083_000004_000002 Here, where the North Fork stream fell into the Ottanoonsis, was a resort exactly to his liking.
7176_88083_000009_000000 Just about this time, in the clear blue overhead, a green winged teal was beating his way above the treetops, making for the stream with the fear of death at his heart.
7176_88083_000013_000001 In fact, he had just finished it-the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet-when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped.
7176_88083_000013_000002 Happily for him, he on his part caught sight of the hawk, and dropped like lead into the torrent.
7176_88083_000005_000005 In every line and hue he was unmistakably an aristocrat among ducks, and an arrogant one at that.
7176_88083_000015_000004 Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.
7176_88083_000023_000006 For a moment the fisherman, bewildered, tried to play him like a salmon.
7176_88083_000001_000000 The Fisher in the Chutes
7176_88083_000016_000005 It was a mongrel method of progression, in which he was singularly expert.
7176_88083_000013_000003 The hawk alighted on the dead branch, and sat upright, motionless, as if surprised.
7176_88083_000022_000002 He saw the great hawk swoop savagely.
7176_88083_000009_000002 But behind him, overtaking him inexorably, came the shape that stood for doom itself in the eyes of all his tribe-the dreadful blue falcon, or duck hawk.
7176_88083_000005_000004 His feet were red, his long narrow beak, with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip, was bright red.
7176_88083_000012_000001 A pounce, and the great cat had her paw upon it, and crouched snarling up at the hawk.
7176_88083_000014_000001 Like his unfortunate little cousin, the teal, he, too, had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart, and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank, deep fringed with weeds, where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him.
7176_88083_000024_000004 There was no such thing as a hawk in sight.
7176_88083_000018_000003 The wily drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself, and was now darting onward at a safe depth.
7176_88083_000005_000000 For all the splendor of his plumage, the merganser was not conspicuous where he sat
7176_88083_000014_000000 The fisher of the chutes, meanwhile, was swimming straight downstream for the broken water.
7176_88083_000003_000001 This branch was thrust out very obligingly in just the place where this most singular of ducks would have desired it if it had been consulted in the matter.
7176_88083_000024_000003 He dived and caught it, came to the surface and swallowed it. Much refreshed, he looked about him.
7176_88083_000019_000001 The hawk, embittered by the loss of his first quarry, had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel, not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived.
7176_88083_000006_000002 His beak, with its keen toothed edges, was a formidable weapon, by means of which he could doubtless have captured, disabled, and dragged to shore even a fish of a pound or so in weight.
7176_88083_000004_000003 And most of the fish-trout, salmon, grilse or parr-which journeyed up and down either the Fork or the parent river chose to pass through that sluice of swift but unbroken flow immediately beneath the overhanging branch on which he perched.
7176_88083_000015_000000 The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.
7176_88083_000012_000005 The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176_88083_000010_000002 For all its appalling speed, the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.
7176_88083_000012_000000 As it chanced, however, the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat.
7176_88083_000024_000002 For a good ten minutes he waited, moveless, with the patience of the wild things. Then his terror faded, appetite once more began to invite his attention, and he took note of a minnow flickering slowly over the sun flecked mud below him.
7176_88083_000011_000000 Close ahead of him now the teal saw refuge-the flashing line of the rapids.
7176_88083_000023_000001 At the sudden sharp sting of it, the great bird turned his head and noticed, for the first time, the fisherman standing on the bank.
7176_88083_000015_000002 Almost instantly he was forced to the top.
7176_88083_000020_000001 He had three flies on his cast, and, because in these waters there was always the chance of hooking a grilse, he was using heavy tackle.
7176_88083_000024_000000 The drake, unrealizing that the dreadful chase was done, sped onward beneath the surface till he could go without breath no longer.
7176_88083_000016_000003 He would have been drowned, the breath battered clean out of him, in half a minute more, had he maintained the hopelessly unequal struggle.
7176_88083_000019_000000 The odds, however, were now laid heavily against the fugitive.
7176_88083_000017_000005 Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer,--but not quite within grasping reach.
7176_88083_000019_000002 The rapids would presently come to an end.
7176_88083_000013_000000 The spot where all this happened was perhaps a hundred yards below that dead tree upon whose outthrust naked branch the splendid merganser drake was making his meal.
7176_88083_000024_000001 Then he came up among some arrowweeds, lifted his head beneath the shelter of one of the broad barbed leaves, and floated there quivering.
7176_88083_000016_000002 As long as his body was completely submerged, it was at the mercy of the twisting and tortured currents, which rolled him over and over, in spite of his swimming craft.
7176_88083_000006_000004 He had no rending claws.
7176_88083_000005_000002 The rapids were foam white, or golden ruddy, or deep, shining green brown under the sharp and patchy sunlight, and they were sown thickly with wet black rocks, here and there glinting with purple.
7176_88083_000005_000003 The merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black, a broad collar of lustrous white, black back, black and white wings, white belly, sides finely pencilled in black and white, and a breast of rich chestnut red, streaked with black.
7176_88083_000007_000000 But suddenly, straight and swift as a diving cormorant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.
7176_88083_000010_000000 The teal's wings, throbbing with a swift, short vibration, whistled shrilly in the still air, so that a prowling wildcat by the waterside heard the sound even above the dull roar of the rapids, and glared upward alertly.
7176_88083_000003_000000 In fact, after the fashion of a cormorant or a kingfisher, he was perched motionless on a big dead stub of a branch.
